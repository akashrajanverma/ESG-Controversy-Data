        "file_name": "2023-07-04_62392597.txt",
        "full_text": "When Joe Biden was running for president, he made environmental justice a cornerstone of his campaign. After he was elected, he honored his pledge by making environmental justice part of everything his administration does. But what is it, exactly? Every discussion begins by defining its terms. For that, let\u2019s turn to Wikipedia:\r\nEnvironmental justice is a social movement to address Environmental injustice, which is the exposure of poor and marginalized communities to harm from hazardous waste, resource extraction, and other land uses from which they do not receive benefits. The movement has generated hundreds of studies showing that exposure to environmental harm is inequitably distributed. Environmental justice is the fair treatment and meaningful involvement of all people regardless of race, color, national origin, or income, with respect to the development, implementation, and enforcement of environmental laws, regulations, and policies.\r\nEnvironmental justice is typically defined as distributive justice, which is the equitable distribution of environmental risks and benefits. Some definitions address procedural justice, which is the fair and meaningful participation in decision-making. Other scholars emphasize recognition justice, which is the recognition of oppression and difference in environmental justice communities. People\u2019s capacity to convert social goods into a flourishing community is a further criteria for a just society.\r\nThe United States Environmental Protection Agency defines environmental justice as:\u201dThe fair treatment and meaningful involvement of all people regardless of race, color, national origin, or income, with respect to the development, implementation, and enforcement of environmental laws, regulations, and policies.\u201d\r\nEnvironmental justice is also discussed as environmental racism or environmental inequality.\r\nBiden And Environmental Justice\r\nEnvironmental justice has become a big priority for progressive Democrats and the Biden administration. Earlier this year, House Natural Resources ranking member Ra\u00fal Grijalva, a Democrat from Arizona, reintroduced the Environmental Justice for All Act, H.R. 1705, which would help communities fight projects that contribute to legacy pollution.\r\nIn an April executive order, Biden defined environmental justice to be the just treatment and meaningful involvement of all people, regardless of income, race, color, national origin, tribal affiliation, or disability, in agency decision-making and other Federal activities that affect human health and the environment.\r\nHoo boy, that really got House Republicans riled up. To them, environmental justice is just another \u201cwoke\u201d scheme to disempower white people. What has their jodhpurs so jangled is the same blatantly racist animus that opposes critical race theory, Black Lives Matter, and racial preference in college admissions. Whites have ruled America since the first member of the Mayflower party to set foot on Cape Cod, who preceded to murder the first native person he encountered.\r\nIt continued in the plantation society that was concentrated in the south but was in fact common throughout the colonies. It is not widely known that many of the picturesque stone walls that are a defining characteristic of New England were not built by industrious farmers but by slaves \u2014 both Blacks and Native Americans. After World War II, the Federal Housing Administration was created to help returning veterans buy a home, but many of the communities where Black people lived were \u201credlined\u201d by the banks, shutting the people who lived there out of the home ownership scheme that became the basis of a rejuvenated middle class.\r\nNixon contrived the War On Drugs in order to punish the Black Panthers for daring to seek power for their communities, which is the primary reason why nearly a third of all Black men have prison records. Perhaps you have never considered the consequences of those policies, but ask yourself a question: If you have a criminal record, what doors are closed to you that are open to everyone else?\r\nHere\u2019s a hint. According to the Brookings Institute, in 2019 the median white household held $188,200 in wealth 7.8 times the $24,100 of the typical Black household. As a result, Black families and other marginalized citizens of the United States, can only afford to buy the lowest priced properties in the worst neighborhoods that are often next door to oil refineries and chemical plants that manufacture plastics and fertilizers that may be harmful to the health of those exposed to them.\r\nThe Republican Rage Machine\r\nAnd yet, any attempt to address those inequalities \u2014 which are clearly unconstitutional \u2014 have sent House Republicans into a rage that has their faces covered in spittle as they rail against any and all efforts to give minorities a fair shake when it comes to where and how federal dollars get spent.\r\nAccording to E&amp;E News, a service of Politico, at a hearing before the House Natural Resources Committee earlier this year, Representative Tom Tiffany, a Republican from Wisconsin asked a representative from WE ACT for Environmental Justice, Do you look at lives that are saved as a result of having affordable energy?\r\nHe then informed Dana Johnson, senior director of strategy and federal policy at WE ACT, that infant mortality rates had gone down significantly in the United States since 1900 while life expectancy has risen. He said he wanted to know if such data points were considered in her environmental justice analyses because affordable energy was part of the reason that those great advances were made.\r\nThe point, Tiffany said, was that it was important to consider trade-offs when analyzing who is affected by oil and gas projects, explaining that there were good things that have come from affordable energy. Johnson started to explain WE ACT looks holistically at situations, including the discriminatory real estate practice known as redlining, but Tiffany cut her off, telling her to send her analysis to his office.\r\nTiffanys line of questioning is part of a broader trend among Republicans who are seeking to counter the growing environmental justice movement, which is focused on addressing disproportionate pollution affecting poor and minority communities, E&amp;E News says.\u00a0The GOP argues that fossil fuels, far from being a problem for the poor and disadvantaged, have been and continue to be a net benefit to humanity. Moreover, Team R says the transition to renewable energy is making rural and working class people pay higher energy costs, forcing millions of Americans into energy poverty.\r\nProgressives reject such pro-fossil fuel arguments. Who has benefited? The 1 percent has benefited in leaps and bounds, said Michele Roberts, an environmental justice advocate from Delaware. Meanwhile you have people living on the fence line. These communities that dont even have access to clean drinking water.\r\nRepublicans are marshaling their arguments and pushing action as part of a wider effort to short circuit or at least redefine environmental justice efforts. Last month, Representative August Pfluger, a Republican from Texas, introduced H.R. 3256, a bill that would kill a recent Biden executive order requiring the federal government to engage in early consultation with front line communities and tribes on energy projects.\r\nPfluger, whose district sits atop the Permian Basin, attacked the order. This president is completely out of touch with the American people and the issues they are facing in their daily lives due to the policy failures of his administration, he snarled in an interview with (wait for it) \u201cFox News.\u201d\r\n[Now that is interesting, since just before the US Supreme Court snuck out of town for a much needed summer vacation, it ruled that when the federal government signed a treaty with the\u00a0Navajo Nation guaranteeing them that certain lands would be theirs in perpetuity, the treaty did not convey a right to clean water as part of the deal.]\r\nPockets Of Energy Poverty\r\nRepublicans increasingly argue that pockets of energy poverty are rampant throughout the country and in rural areas. [Of course, they offer no proof to support their arguments, a tactic Roy Cohn taught Joseph McCarthy before he shared it with Donald Trump.] It\u2019s an idea that has circulated in conservative circles for years but has gained greater traction in the Biden years. Representative Harriet Hageman, a Republican from Wyoming, recently hit Interior Secretary Deb Haaland over the head with it during a hearing before the Natural Resources Committee.\r\nDo you believe energy poverty is a good thing? she demanded.\u00a0Her tone grew sharper after Haaland replied that she was unfamiliar with the term. Hageman said, Its probably pretty self-explanatory, though, dont you think? Haaland replied, I think what were really trying to do with our clean energy goals is make energy more affordable for every single American. And since every single industry source shows that renewable energy is cheaper than thermal generation, it is hard to see what Hageman was banging on about.\r\nYou won\u2019t find Representative Hageman complaining about the billions and billions of dollars ratepayers in Georgia will be saddled with for decades because of cost overruns at the Vogtle nuclear power plant. Hageman seems to be incapable of anything other than regurgitating talking points spoon fed to her by fossil fuel lobbyists and the Republican National Committee.\r\nThe brazen assault on renewable energy and environmental justice focus a spotlight on just how far Republicans are willing to go to protect their masters \u2014 the fossil fuel companies who bought and paid for their political campaigns \u2014 and the rabid racism of their constituents. They must hold their noses and gag when they recite the Pledge of Allegiance, especially when they get to the part about \u201cliberty and justice for all.\u201d\r\nClearly, the Republican Party doesn\u2019t care a flying fig leaf about such things. All they can think of is protecting their corporate masters and throwing red meat to the snarling, flag-waving mob that elected them. All Americans are entitled to the blessings of liberty, and those who would deny others that right should do us all a favor and go back to the countries their ancestors came from. Happy Fourth of July, everyone.\r\n\u00a0\r\nI don't like paywalls. You don't like paywalls. Who likes paywalls?

        "full_text": "Zachary Bradford, chief executive officer of CleanSpark, during the Bitcoin 2023 conference in Miami ... [+] Beach, Florida, US, on Saturday, May 20, 2023. The three-day conference is touted by organizers as \"the biggest annual celebration of Bitcoin in the world.\" Photographer: Eva Marie Uzcategui/Bloomberg\r\n\u00a9 2023 Bloomberg Finance LP\r\nWhat I love about Bitcoinis that we can operate in a manner that not only avoids damage, but rather, is additive, CleanSpark CEO Zach Bradford told me in our interview when discussing the impact bitcoin mining is having on grids and communities.\r\nCleanSpark is a publicly traded bitcoin mining company that uses a mix of nuclear, hydroelectric, solar, and wind power to mine bitcoin. Something often lost in the discussion on sustainability is its purpose. Its not just to use low carbon energy for the sake of it, rather we do it to make an impact, Bradford explained about their intentions.\r\nAccording to Bradford, Americas grid is more fragile than most people understand, requiring a lot of investment to build back resiliency. Bitcoin minings unique power consumption characteristics make it the perfect complement to underutilized or stranded sources of power.\r\nIn addition to creating jobs, CleanSpark has invested hundreds of millions of dollars into rural communities, funding projects from substation improvements to powerline and pole replacement.\r\nThere are a number of bitcoin miners who are utilizing sustainable energy sources or waste energy. These operators are positively impacting the environment, the grid, and communities around the world. Here are just a few examples of how they are making a difference.\r\nCrusoe Energy\r\nCully Cavness is the Co-Founder, President and Chief Operating Officer of Crusoe Energy. Prior to co-founding Crusoe, Cavness served in leadership and management positions in the upstream oil &amp; gas industry and geothermal energy industry as well as in energy investment banking.\r\nCrusoe got their start by tapping into the methane that oil and gas operators previously had to flare. In doing so, the methane is combusted in a more thorough way, reducing emissions. Crusoe also builds data centers in a cooperative way with wind and solar in order to smooth their production curves to reduce strain on the grid.\r\nBitcoin can be a tremendous tool to reduce methane emissions, Cavness said in our interview. In 2022, the Crusoe team said that they reduced natural gas flaring by over 4 billion cubic feet, mitigated 6,400 metric tons of methane emissions, and reduced more emissions than they generated, leading to net-negative emissions.\r\nCrusoe is now expanding their data centers services into cloud and AI computing. They also recently opened an operation in Argentina, a potentially vital lifeline amid the countrys ongoing currency crisis.\r\nTeraWulf\r\nKerri Langlais is the Chief Strategy Officer for TeraWulf Inc., a publicly traded bitcoin mining company that also uses zero carbon energy sources.\r\nLanglais told me in our interview that TeraWulf will only locate facilities in places where there is a supply-demand imbalance. In doing so, she says that they can have a symbiotic relationship with the grid and grid operators.\r\nAs an example, TeraWulf recently became the first bitcoin mining facility in the US that is directly connected to a nuclear power plant. Langlais referred to TeraWulf as an energy sink, utilizing power that is generated regardless, but would otherwise go unused and unpaid for.\r\nIn doing so, TeraWulf increases the utilization of the power plant during periods of lower demand, spreading the fixed costs over a larger consumption pool, reducing costs for consumers.\r\nSazmining\r\nHaving built my career on harmonizing humanitys relationship with the planet, I couldnt see a better place to put my work focus, Kent Halliburton said in our interview, referencing his prior experience in the renewable energy sector and newfound passion for bitcoin.\r\nHalliburton is the president and COO overseeing the development of bitcoin mining operations at Sazmining, a company that provides retail investors with an easy way to invest in bitcoin mining.\r\nHalliburton said he left his prior career to focus on renewable energy powered bitcoin mining after learning about bitcoin and realizing the powerful synergies between the two worlds.\r\nSimilar to TeraWulf, Sazmining consumes the excess power from hydroelectric facilities. Halliburton says they focus on hydroelectric because of its low cost and reliability.\r\nAs bitcoin mining permeates the energy industry, it has the potential to revitalize rural America and drive development in the global south, all while mitigating emissions and bolstering existing grids.\r\nThe incentives are complex, but the results are beginning to make themselves clear. Bitcoin mining is here to stay, and it might be just what we need to modernize our energy infrastructure.",

plans for the World's Top 6 Agriculture Equipment producing OEMs.\r\nThe report provides comprehensive insights &amp; strategic analysis into the World's Top 6 Agriculture Equipment Manufacturers with focus on a blend of quantitative &amp; qualitative analysis based on an assessment of their relative market positioning, capabilities, strategic responsiveness &amp; resilience and the ability to adapt &amp; navigate their way through market turbulence &amp; effectively capitalize upon emerging, potential growth opportunities.\r\nThe Global Agriculture Equipment market is witnessing strong demand for new equipment owing to strong farm incomes &amp; favourable farm economics while battling supply side disruptions &amp; challenges emanating from supply chain disruptions, bottlenecks &amp; shortages creating production capacity constraints in an overall complex, difficult &amp; highly challenging market environment marked by rising inflation &amp; interest rates, tectonic geopolitical shifts and climate change challenges across most key markets &amp; regions globally.\r\nThe ongoing Russia-Ukraine war has been the latest variable added to the overall market equation &amp; dynamics for agriculture commodities with constraints on Ukraine's agriculture exports from Black Sea based ports since early 2022 having created supply shortfalls globally for grains &amp; other key agriculture commodities which has, in turn, driven up commodity prices and bolstered farm incomes globally.\r\nFavourable farm economics, with strong farm incomes &amp; agriculture commodity prices, along with the ongoing energy transition, with imminent shift towards sustainable sources of energy &amp; sustainability, have collectively been driving up replacement demand for new agriculture equipment across most markets &amp; regions as of late\r\nPrecision agriculture has witnessed a substantial growth since its foray into mainstream agriculture since early part of the previous decade with most industry OEMs having rapidly built-up technological capabilities, scale and broadened products &amp; services portfolios significantly with focus on digital transformation via the inorganic route through bolt-on acquisitions, while also harnessing tech potential of start-ups.\r\nThe technology focus currently for the industry OEMs is on connectivity, autonomous capabilities and sustainability through rapid development of sustainable fuels-based drive-trains, including, electric, both battery electric &amp; hydrogen fuel cells based apart from CNG &amp; LNG for agriculture machinery\r\nThe long term market fundamentals for agriculture, however, remain robust and firmly in place with the global agriculture output needed to double itself by 2050 to sustain the projected population growth rate with a crucial role likely to be played by mechanization &amp; technological evolution by the industry with focus on sustainability which is likely to be supported &amp; further accelerated by key initiatives, like the H2Accelerate program by the industry in EU to accelerate the uptake of green hydrogen, and the creation of First Movers Coalition; geared towards jumpstarting the scalability of sustainable technologies through the end of current decade\r\nThe report provides detailed analysis on the OEMs, including:\r\n<ul><li>Comprehensive Analysis of Business Portfolio across Industry OEMs</li><li>Strategic Market Positioning, Capabilities and Responsiveness</li><li>Overarching Strategy Focus</li><li>Key Strategies &amp;

        "file_name": "2023-07-04_62392601.txt",
        "full_text": "The European Unions top court has issued a ruling that could lead to major changes in the way Meta Platforms Inc. operates its ad business.\r\nThe Luxembourg-based Court of Justice of the European Union, or CJEU, released a summary of the ruling today. The decision is the culmination of a long-running legal battle focused on Metas data collection practices.\u00a0\r\nThe saga began in 2016 when Germanys competition regulator, the Federal Cartel Office, started investigating the way Meta collects users personal information. The focus of the probe was the manner in which Meta, then Facebook Inc., made use of so-called off-Facebook data. Thats user information the company collects from WhatsApp and Instagram, plus third-party websites and apps.\r\nUsers agree to Metas data collection practices when they sign up for Facebook. However, the Federal Cartel Office determined that an obligatory tick on the box was an insufficient basis for Metas aggregation of off-Facebook data. GDPR, the EUs privacy regulation, requires companies to receive permission from users before processing their information.\r\nIn 2019, three years after opening its investigation, the Federal Cartel Office ordered Meta to change its data collection practices. Meta appealed the decision at the Higher Regional Court of D\u00fcsseldorf shortly thereafter. The court then referred the case to the CJEU, which is what led to todays ruling against the social networking giant.\r\nMeta argued in its appeal that the Federal Cartel Office, a competition regulator, overstepped its authority when it sought to address a data privacy matter. Violations of the EUs GDPR privacy law are often referred to a different regulator. In its ruling today, the CJEU dismissed Metas argument.\r\nIn the context of the examination of an abuse of a dominant position by an undertaking, it may be necessary for the competition authority of the Member State concerned also to examine whether that undertakings conduct complies with rules other than those relating to competition law, such as the rules laid down by the GDPR, the court stated.\r\nIn its 2019 decision on Metas collection of off-Facebook data, the Federal Cartel Office ordered the company to change the relevant business practices. The regulator stated that Meta must receive users permission before aggregating their data from third-party apps and websites.\u00a0\r\nIn the same decision, the Federal Cartel Office ruled that Meta may continue collecting data from WhatsApp and Instagram as before. However, officials ordered the company to ask for users permission before linking that data with personal information collected via Facebook. Linking user data from multiple sources is a common practice in the digital ad industry.\u00a0\r\nAt the time of the regulators 2019 decision, it was reported that Meta could face fines equal to up to 10% of its annual revenues if it fails to comply with the order.\r\nThe Federal Cartel Office welcomed todays CJEU ruling. Data is a decisive factor in establishing market power, Federal Cartel Office president Andreas Mundt said in a statement to Reuters. The use of the very personal data of consumers by the large internet companies can also be abusive under antitrust law.\r\nMeta stated in response to the ruling that \u201cwe are evaluating the Court\u2019s decision and will have more to say in due course.\r\nYour vote of support is important to us and it helps us keep the content FREE.\r\nOne-click below supports our mission to provide free, deep and relevant content. \u00a0\r\nJoin the community that includes more than 15,000 #CubeAlumni experts, including Amazon.com CEO Andy Jassy, Dell Technologies founder and CEO Michael Dell, Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger and many more luminaries and experts.\r\nTheCUBE\u00a0is an important partner to the industry.

        "full_text": "Bengaluru/Mumbai: About eighty minutes into the virtual annual general meeting of Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) on Friday, Hyderabad resident and company shareholder Praful Chavda asked the question everyone tuning in had been anticipating. Sir,\" Chavda started, speaking in Hindi, addressing TCS chairman Natarajan Chandrasekaran, who is also the chairman of parent Tata Sons, one of Indias largest and best-regarded business houses. There was this news in the media where it was mentioned something was wrong with the recruitment process.\"\r\n Chavda was referring to the bribes-for- jobs scam at TCS, which was first reported by this paper on 23 June.\r\n Sir, the strictest of action should be taken and no leniency should be offered. So that no one can ever think of repeating the same.\" Chavda was not the only worried shareholder; four other shareholders expressed their bafflement over how such an episode could occur.\r\n For Chandra, as he is addressed by colleagues, and for TCS, this was an unusual and somewhat unfortunate moment. The man and the institution in many ways represent the best of Indian capitalism. Chandra, who started as a trainee at TCS in 1987, worked his way up to become not just the companys CEO, but eventually the chairman of the $128 billion parent, which employs more than a million people.\r\n TCS is as unalloyed a success story as it gets in corporate India. Founded in 1968, it grew to become Indias largest IT services company and a flagbearer for this critical industry. It counts close to 60% of Fortune 500 as its clients. With $27.9 billion in 2023 revenues and $5.2 billion in profits, its the crown jewel of the Tata empire. Landing a job at TCS straight out of college, in many parts of the country, is nearly as effective a booster for a young mans marital prospects as a government job.\r\n If Chandra epitomises meritocratic success, TCS is something of a shrine to it.\r\n Thats why revelations last week that some employees of the company took bribes from third-party staffing firms were met with widespread shock and disbelief.\r\n It was that disbelief that shareholders at the AGM channelled in their questions to Chandra.\r\n A visibly distraught Chandra, who was sitting in the TCS House in Mumbai, heard all the questions from the shareholders. And then he broke his silence on this subject, in a rare public expression of anguish.\r\n [W]henever there is a violation of ethical conduct by any employee it pains us. And pains me. And all the leaders very deeply. And we take it extremely seriously. We deal with it (with) very strong action,\" said Chandrasekaran.\r\n He added that two complaints were about certain favouritism being done and certain favours being received in recruitment\" of temporary workers from contract staffing firms. Consequently, TCS sacked six employees and blacklisted six staffing firms even as a probe continues against three more employees.\r\n We cannot quantify what favours they got but they certainly behaved in a way that they were favouring certain firms,\" Chandra said.\r\n TCS continues to probe this episode. One immediate fallout, according to one executive who spoke on the condition of anonymity, has been that senior executives are fielding questions from top clients about the episode.\r\n TCS did not respond to questions for this story.\r\nThe Whistle Blows\r\nIn the last week of February, a whistleblower wrote to the then CEO Rajesh Gopinathan, bringing to light that the then head of Resource Management Group (known within the company as RMG) and certain executives in his team were taking bribes for hiring contract workers. A few weeks later, another email was received by Gopinathan, pointing to the mess inside RMG in India.\r\n These two emails couldnt have come at a worse time. The senders couldnt have known, but TCS was on the cusp of a surprise leadership change.\r\n About a fortnight after the first email landed, on 15 March, TCS appointed K. Krithivasan after the surprise departure of Gopinathan.\r\n To TCSs credit, the company quickly swung into action and set up two probe teams.\r\n After five weeks of inquiry, heads began to roll. In the third week of April, the first executive to be sent on leave was the then-head of RMG, E.S. Chakravarthy. Later, the company appointed Sivakumar Viswanathan, a veteran of about 30 years, as the head of RMG.\r\n At least four other current and former RMG executives have moved out of the company in the last five weeks. Mint is not disclosing their names due to our inability to independently ascertain as yet if all these departures were related to the scandal. The executives who have moved out of TCS include a senior RMG leader in New Jersey and Bengaluru and a former RMG Head in Hyderabad.\r\n Arun G.K., a member of the RMG Team in the US, was summoned by TCS to fly down from New Jersey. Arun, who had moved to the US from Canada at the start of the year, was subsequently asked to put in his papers.\r\n Sometime after 24 June, he deleted his LinkedIn profile.\r\n All the above executives had been with TCS for more than 15 years.\r\nThe role of RMG\r\nTech outsourcing firms such as TCS need to possess one critical trait in their human resource operationsagility. They need to be able to quickly deploy and redeploy large numbers of people with very specific tech skills into projects.\r\n RMG is in that sense the heart of TCS. Like the organ that pumps blood to various parts of the body, RMG determines how its 614,795 employees are deployed to projects. It also augments its large workforce by recruiting contract workers. The task of recruiting permanent staff to the company is done by Talent Acquisition Group (TAG), which is part of the companys HR department. RMG, even as it collaborated with HR, rolled up to the companys chief operating officer (COO), N Ganapathy Subramaniam. Chakravarthy, the suspended RMG head, reported to Subramaniam, who has worked at TCS since 1982 and is due to retire next year. He also happens to be Chandrasekarans elder brother.\r\n Inside TCS, RMG puts almost 1,400 engineers into projects, every day, averaging one placement every minute.\r\n Because you cant hire people after a project lands, IT firms typically have a floating population of staff that are not deployed to any project. If 100 people are employed by a firm but only 90 are allotted to billable projects, in industry parlance, its said the firms current utilization rate is 90%. Keeping the utilization rate high is critical to profitability, as you dont want to pay more staff than what clients are paying for. The task of keeping the utilization rate consistently high, while ensuring projects are not delayed due to lack of manpower, is one of the delicate dances IT firms must perform well. At TCS, RMGs efforts determine the utilization rate.\r\n Because delivery in tech services hinges on steady and timely supply of manpower, the head of RMG is a powerful leader within the company. As RMG is critical to their ability to deliver, leaders within the company tend to keep the RMG head and senior leaders in good humour, two executives who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said.\r\n Say TCS wins a $50 million deal. Before the company looks to hire from outside, people within the organization are deployed on the project. This is where the RMG head plays the most important role. Now, the profitability of any contract is a function of the people deployed on a project. He (RMG Head) can redeploy people and no one can question his decision,\" said a former executive. Inside TCS, no one can question the RMGs authority. The RMG can always fault the profitability of a current project and take out people from the project,\" one executive said.\r\nYou are my nuclear reactor\r\nFor this reason, the role of Chakravarthy, or Chaks, as colleagues called him, is at the heart of this episode. Before taking over as the global head of the RMG in 2018, Chakravarthy served as the head of the companys Bengaluru centre for a little more than eight years.\r\n Chaks has always been the brand ambassador for TCS in colleges in Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu,\" said a second executive. Him getting embroiled in this case is the biggest setback as the companys reputation built over the last two decades in colleges will take a beating.\"\r\n An engineer by training, Chakravarthy joined TCS in 1997 and climbed up the ranks through what his former colleagues describe as an uncommonly efficient work ethic.\r\n Once Chaks got a message from Rajesh (Gopinathan, the former CEO), complimenting him for his work. It said: You (Chakravarthy) are my nuclear reactor,\" said one executive with direct knowledge of the message.\r\n His ability to get people deployed on projects is unparalleled,\" he added.\r\n Chakravarthys proximity to the top brass of TCS (read the CEO and COO), the extent of which he never shied away from letting others in the company know, combined with his own influence as RMG head, made him an intimidating figure in the eyes of many peers, according to two executives.\r\n Chaks is a micromanager and he ran it (RMG) like a tight ship,\" said one of the executives. He (Chaks) picked all the people in key leadership roles at RMG. To give you an example, typically, RMG and HR staff people get relatively fewer opportunities to work overseas. Even if they go, there is a rotational policy designed to extend overseas postings to as many staff within these departments as possible. In the last decade, Arun spent more than seven years overseasfirst in Chile, then in Canada and most recently in the US. All this makes me believe it is highly surprising he (Chakravarthy) was not aware of what was going on inside RMG,\" one executive said, implying Arun was favoured by Chakravarthy.\r\n Another executive was more scathing.\r\n If the DCP of an area is not doing his job, then what is the incentive for the station in-charge or constable to maintain order?\"\r\n Calls and text messages to Chakravarthy seeking comments went unanswered.\r\nAnatomy of the scam\r\nHow could something of this nature happen at TCS, reputed for water-tight corporate governance practices, internal audits and other checks finetuned over decades of working with top global corporations and their compliance teams?\r\n The simple answer is that even best in class processes can be hoodwinked by people determined to abuse their authority.\r\n In the aftermath of Covid-19, as the world went virtual and remote, companies around the world scrambled to deploy solutions that allowed them to carry on their business with limited physical contact with customers. This means building more digital applications, chatbots and web interfaces, along with reconfiguring internal process to meet new realities.\r\n To build these solutions, they turned to trusted technology partners they have worked with for yearsIndian IT services firms. This meant a groundswell of business for Indias IT sector and despite the forces of automation winding their way through the industry, projects needed manpower in unprecedented numbers.\r\n Typically if you ask recruitment teams, it will take 90-120 days for you to get a batch of candidates,\" said a fourth TCS executive interviewed for this story. What is a company supposed to do? Twiddle its thumbs and wait for the contract to get scrapped or incur billing losses? No, right?\"\r\n It is here that contract staffing firms or Business Associates, the nomenclature that TCS uses, come into the picture. Business Associates can help you with resources in 15-30 days,\" said the executive cited above.\r\n IT firms, like most companies in the manufacturing space, have an empanelled list of vendors, including contract staffing firms.\r\n But TCSs RMG runs a tad differently, according to two former company executives.\r\n At most companies, the procurement department does the verification checks and decides which staffing firms to register. At TCS, the RMG team is empowered to enlist contract staffing firms, said one executive.\r\n This authorization appears to have been misused by a few people. As for staffing firms, in a high-demand environment, getting empanelled by such a major employer was a sure ticket to business volumes.\r\n For the last two years, it was an open secret that many people of RMG were allegedly abusing their power by demanding an upfront commission for the empanelment process of staffing firms,\" said the fourth executive.\r\n Mint learned of another episode, as recounted by two executives, that pointed to ethical breaches around the empanelment of new staffing firms.\r\n Early this year, Sage IT, a staffing firm headquartered out of Chennai with offices across the world, wanted to work with TCS. A few weeks after it reached out to the company, co-founder Sagar Pelaprolu got a call from an executive claiming to be from TCS, according to a former TCS executive with direct knowledge of the incident.\r\n The caller demanded a hefty sum (seven-digit sum in rupees) in return for empanelling the company. Pelaprolu declined to pay, the executive cited above said.\r\n Multiple emails sent to Pelaprolu seeking comment went unanswered. The second executive confirmed he was aware of concerns of an ethical breach involving Sage IT but was not aware of the details. Its unclear if Pelaprolu ever made an official complaint about the incident.\r\n Another way in which some TCS executives have allegedly profited is by sharing information about staffing needs with a few favoured vendors ahead of others.\r\n Inside TCS, the leader of a business unit raises the request for the number of people and skill sets that are needed.\r\n Ideally, the RMG team should have shared this information on the companys internal portal, called Ultimatix, an enterprise resource planning platform. Ultimatix has over 200 apps, including Global Business Associate Management (GBAM) System, that the 1,000-odd empanelled contract staffing firms can access.\r\n Whenever a business unit head inside TCS needs people, a request is raised and it shows up in the GBAM app. Subsequently, all BA firms would upload the resume of people on GBAM.\r\n But over the last two years, contract staffing firms that allegedly paid commissions to some of the RMG executives got to know the requirements ahead of others. This allowed these staffing firms to directly email the resumes of the candidates to the RMG executive, who then secured approvals from the business unit heads, who might not have known about the process bypass.\r\n Unlike permanent workers, when staffing firms supply temporary manpower, they typically dont go through a stringent interview process within tech firms.\r\n In effect, the Ultimatix platform, designed to offer a level playing field to TCS vendors, was bypassed for personal gains.\r\n Which contract staffing firms benefitted thus?\r\n According to multiple executives familiar with the situation, two of the five staffing firms that have been thus far been blacklisted by TCS may have ties with Chakravarthy amounting to inappropriateness, if not outright conflict of interest.\r\n Chakravarthys first cousin Rakesh Edupuganti is director of operations at Foray Software Pvt Ltd, a Hyderabad-based staffing firm that has been barred by TCS. This relationship between Chakravarthy and Edupuganti was never disclosed to TCS and was discovered by the company in its ongoing probe.\r\n Taltech Technologies Pvt Ltd is a Bengaluru-based contract staffing firm that is the second staffing firm that has been blacklisted by TCS. Taltech was founded by Sudhakar Rao Puchakayla and Kranthi Sagar Puchakayla in December 2018.\r\n Kranthi Sagar, a former TCS executive, left the company in the summer of 2018 and set up a staffing company, which in about two years managed to get drafted with TCS.\r\n The founder of Taltech and Foray Software and Chakravarthy are all from Ongole town in Prakasam district of Andhra Pradesh.\r\n One executive said the firm was blacklisted as it has emerged that Chakravarthys wife is related to Kranthi Sagars wife Gurram Soudami, also a director of Taltech.\r\n It is important to mention here that Taltech and Foray Software are the biggest BA firms or contract staffing firms for TCS in all of South India, placing thousands of engineers at the marquee IT firm.\r\n We could not get onto TCS contract hiring list for more than five years, despite being one of the fastest-growing recruitment firms. We did not accept some of their demands made from the RMG team,\" said the chief executive of a Bengaluru-based staffing firm.\r\n Three other contract staffing firms that have been blacklisted by TCS are IDC Technologies Ltd, USG Inc. and Tech Orbit Inc, according to executives with knowledge of the developments.\r\n IDC Technologies, Tech Orbit and USG Inc. (through Stratosphere IT services in India) have been enlisted by TCS both in the US and India. Now, Indias largest IT services firm has blacklisted them in both countries.\r\n An email sent to Taltech and Tech Orbit went unanswered while USG and Stratosphere IT could not be reached. Foray and IDC Technologies deny that their engagement has been terminated.\r\nMore ways than one\r\nIn addition to seeking upfront money for the empanelment of contract staffing firms and sharing insider information with a few contract staffing firms, there were two other ways errant executives are alleged to have profited themselves.\r\n One is by taking a commission from staffing firms on the total billing. Some employees in the US are alleged to gave taken commissions on the per-hour rate.\r\n If the rate for someone having proficiency in Java (a coding language) is say $50 an hour, the company paid up to $60-$65 an hour for the person. This is because both the contract staffing firm and RMG executive split the extra $10-15 an hour,\" said the fourth executive.\r\n Unfortunately, there is more.\r\n After all the temp hiring, the approving authority on the invoices is Chakravarthy. In times when there is a huge demand for talent, a companys cost for hiring a contract worker shoots up and so IT services firms budgets for a cost overshoot of 5-10%. TCS, like its peers, calls it a deviation from the pre-fixed rate of contract hires to be offered at the time of enlisting of contract staffing firms. But over the last year, deviation rates of almost all the temp hires were about 25-30% higher.\r\nNo red flags?\r\nA disconcerting issue for many is how the companys audit process missed all these red flags.\r\n Engagement of staffing firms with IT firms like TCS involves compliance audits and process audits. The compliance audit happens on a quarterly basis and is a check if the staffing firm is paying salary, Provident Funds, and following statutory guidelines.\r\n Process audits deals is a review of which vendors got contracts, the reason why contracts were awarded and importantly if any group of vendors is getting a larger share of the pie.\r\n According to multiple staffing firms that Mint spoke to, IT companies had started to neglect process audits during the boom time.\r\n During the period of hiring frenzy, they were guzzling talent and the audits were taking place sporadically. But now that there is a lull, we expect more questions on processes involvedhow we sourced the candidate, did we follow all vendor-related protocols and that no unethical means were used,\" said a head of a Bengaluru-based staffing firm.\r\n Where does TCS go from here?\r\n Last year, Chakravarthy was the chief guest at an event organized by an engineering college in Guntur. During his speech at the Vignans Foundation for Science, Technology, and Research, Chakravarthy prodded students to follow their dreams, bragging: Today, I have a currency of respect because I belong to TCS, the most trusted IT company in the world.\"\r\n Trust that was built over decades and one that the firm must now act quickly to protect.\r\nCatch all the Corporate news and Updates on Live Mint.\r\n Download The Mint News App to get Daily Market Updates &amp; Live Business News.\r\nMoreLess\r\nTopics",

We anticipate the majority of customers from the weekend storm systems will be restored by the end of the day Wednesday, assuming continued safe working conditions and that weather conditions do not delay our progress. \r\nToday, on the July 4 holiday, wehave a total of 1,300 people engaged in restoration -- including line workers, vegetation management, damage assessors, drone teams and safety representatives.. This includes additional mutual aid crews from Illinois.\r\n<ul><li>\r\n Hear more from Launders Wince, director Meramec Valley Division, in the following video link: https://tinyurl.com/2p9fmjp9</li></ul>We'vesafely restored power to approximately 94,000 Missouri customers to date.\r\n<ul><li>\r\n It will take some time to accomplish repairs for remaining customers.\r\n </li><li>\r\n We will work to safely restore power to customers as soon as possible, \r\n </li><li>\r\n We anticipate restoration efforts will extend until Wednesday evening given the damage caused by several waves of powerful weather events.\r\n </li><li>\r\n As we continue damage assessment, we are finding additional destruction of utility infrastructure after brush and debris are cleared. This has delayed restoration for some customers.\r\n </li><li>\r\n As of 11 a.m. on Tuesday, around 27,000 customers are without power. See the Ameren outage map for the latest: www.ameren.com/outagemap</li></ul>\r\n We estimate a total of more than 160 poles have been replaced or still require replacement. \r\nOur crews are addressing significant tree and infrastructure damage caused by strong winds. \r\n<ul><li>\r\n In difficult conditions such as downed tree limbs and challenging terrain, it takes at least four to five hours, sometimes longer, to clear a damaged utility pole and set a replacement. \r\n </li></ul>\r\n We also are seeing damage to transformers and substations.\r\nDrone teams have been deployed to help pinpoint damage quickly and safely so our line crews can focus on restoration efforts. \r\nWhen prioritizing restoration work, Ameren Missouri works to restore power to equipment that serves the greatest number of customers and to critical facilities. Some of the restoration jobs involving critical facilities have required additional specialized equipment be brought to the scene, which has slowed some repairs in some cases. Learn more about how we restore power: Power Restoration - Ameren.com\r\nWe understand that our customers are frustrated, and we ask for patience as our crews work to restore power. We also advise customers to always assume a downed wire is live. Be careful around pools of water. Stay clear of brush, shrubs and downed trees that may hide downed power lines. \r\nWHAT CUSTOMERS CAN DO\r\n<ul><li>\r\n To ensure we can provide you with the latest outage update, we must have your correct phone number or email address. Please create or log in to your Ameren account online to ensure your contact information is correct. \r\n </li><li>\r\n Customers can check the status of their restoration at Ameren.com or download the free Ameren app for updates as they become available. Sign up for alerts. Text REG to AMEREN (263736) to start or visit Ameren.com/Alerts. \r\n </li><li>\r\n When reporting an outage, please use the phone number associated with the account. Entering a number that is not associated with the account will create an error message. \r\n </li><li>\r\n Customers can follow Ameren Missouri on Facebook and Twitter to get the latest information on what's happening with restoration efforts. \r\n </li><li>\r\n Be aware of scammers asking for payment to restore your utility service. If something feels off, hang up or close the door and call us. If you have questions about your account balance, please call Ameren directly. We are here to help. \r\n </li></ul>RESTORATION PRIORITIES\r\nPriority one is to respond to life-threatening emergencies, such as downed-wires, and to handle all problems impacting critical infrastructure such as hospitals and other emergency response facilities - police and fire, and municipal systems.\r\nOnce power is restored to critical infrastructure, we focus on getting the most customers restored in the quickest and most efficient manner. Crews begin with main lines - those that can restore power to perhaps thousands of people - and then move to lines that affect individual homes and neighborhoods.\r\nBecause of their general location along primary power lines, homes in the same neighborhood may be restored at different times. It's also why businesses are sometimes restored first.\r\nWEATHER CHALLENGES\r\n<ul><li>\r\n Highly destructive severe weather cut through the Midwest over a multi-day period last weekend, causing significant and widespread additional outages throughout Missouri.\r\n </li><li>\r\n The entire Ameren Missouri service territory has been affected by the weather, with the St. Louis metropolitan area getting hit the hardest.\r\n </li><li>\r\n We're continuously monitoring weather conditions for additional weather threats this week. As of Tuesday morning, there is a medium threat for severe weather on Wednesday, July 5, throughout Ameren Missouri's entire service territory.\r\n </li></ul>SAFETY\r\n<ul><li>\r\n Safety is the first and foremost concern during any weather event. Stay clear of any downed power lines or poles. Always assume a downed wire is live. Be careful around pools of water. Stay clear of brush, shrubs and downed trees that may hide downed power lines. \r\n </li><li>\r\n Customers should report any downed power lines to the Ameren Missouri customer line: 800.552.7583. \r\n </li><li>\r\n If your power is out, check your circuit breakers or fuses - your service outage might be the result of a household problem. Avoid any risk of electrical shock and do not enter any flooded areas. \r\n </li><li>\r\n Create a plan for seeking shelter in the event of severe weather and discuss the plan with all members of the household.\r\n </li><li>\r\n Keep phones and electronics charged when storms are in the forecast.\r\n </li><li>\r\n Prepare a storm kit with emergency telephone numbers, flashlights and a radio with fresh batteries, along with bottled water and non-perishable foods that don't require heating. Also include medication and special items for infants, the elderly or family members with special needs.\r\n </li></ul>",

In his inaugural speech, Payeng emphasized the importance of biodiversity and the need to educate young children about the significance of planting and nurturing trees. He envisioned children becoming ambassadors in the global movement to recreate a sustainable environment for a live able planet Earth. Payeng passionately expressed that parents entrust their children to nature\u2019s care, as it provides essential elements such as oxygen, sunlight, and more, nurturing them into worthy human beings. He urged the government to implement necessary measures to ban air rifles, thereby preventing the killing of birds. Several states have already taken action in this regard.\r\nPayeng highlighted that the Molai forest, which he initiated 42 years ago, now serves as a home to 115 elephants, tigers, leopards, rhinoceros, and other wildlife. The forest attracts 80% of Indian migratory birds. His dream project of connecting the Molai forest with Kaziranga National Park, a 60- kilometer stretch, is currently in progress, furthering the cause of conservation and biodiversity.\r\nJadav Payeng advocates Planting Sandalwood Trees for Environmental and Economic Benefits. Payeng also highlighted the importance of planting sandalwood trees for their environmental and economic value. Drawing examples from countries like China and Taiwan, Payeng emphasized the need for India to increase its focus on cultivating sandalwood trees, known for their high value. He urged India, with its rich biodiversity and favorable climatic conditions, to also embrace sandalwood plantation as a sustainable and economically viable initiative.\r\nProf D P Goyal, the Director of IIM Shillong, expressed his heartfelt gratitude to all the participants of the Plantation Drive during his welcome address at the 16th Inaugural Day celebration. He extended his congratulations to everyone who has contributed to the growth and development of IIM Shillong since its inception.\r\nIn an important announcement, Prof Goyal declared that July 4th would be celebrated as Inaugural Day every year at IIM Shillong, with a special emphasis on conducting a Plantation Drive. This initiative aims to foster a deep sense of responsibility towards nature and the environment among the institute\u2019s community.\r\nProf Goyal urged all members of the IIM Shillong fraternity, including students, faculty, staff, alumni, and stakeholders, to actively participate in and contribute to the Plantation Drive. He emphasized the importance of individuals&amp;#39; collective efforts in preserving and enhancing the environment for a sustainable future. Prof Goyal, extended his sincere appreciation to the State Forest Department for their invaluable support and cooperation in making the Plantation Drive a success.\r\nThe Plantation Drive received an overwhelming response from delegates, with some even bringing fruit trees from their own collections to contribute to the campus\u2019s greenery. The event, graced by distinguished delegates and stakeholders, witnessed a collective effort to enhance the natural environment at IIM Shillong. Their contribution added a unique touch to the Plantation Drive, as a variety of fruit trees were planted across the campus. The gesture not only symbolizes the delegates commitment to environmental conservation but also showcases their support for IIM Shillongs vision of creating a live able and sustainable planet. The presence of these delegates and their contribution to the Plantation Drive further strengthens the ties between IIM Shillong and the wider community.

        "full_text": "On 3 July 2023, the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) published a speech, delivered at UK Finance by Nathanael Benjamin, Executive Director of Authorisations, Regulatory Technology and International Supervision. In his speech, Mr Benjamin discusses the PRAs 2023 supervisory priorities for international banks and says that banks must be proactive in anticipating the risks posed by the transition to a new macro-economic environment.\r\nKey points discussed in Mr Benjamins speech include:\r\n<ul><li>The global economic outlook: Theimpact of consensus breakdown on credit markets could be significant. Mr Benjamin discusses the various risks that the PRA sees potentially occurring if the macroeconomic outlook worsens, noting that the PRA is particularly concerned about the potential impact that events in the US could have in the UK. He looks at certain business lines and risks that would be particularly vulnerable to the impact of a consensus breakdown and particularly relevant to the PRAs supervisory priorities private equity and private credit, repo matched books, and structured equity derivatives and autocallables.</li></ul><ul><li>Commodities: Mr Benjamin discusses the complex interplay between commodities and climate change, which he says warrants careful consideration even for firms that do not have a commodities franchise or direct commodities exposures. He warns that all banks need to be capable of proactively identifying risks arising from climate change and anticipating when and where they could emerge, as ultimately when they crystallise for the broader economy they crystallise for banks too.</li></ul><ul><li>Business models: The PRA has observed that confidence in the viability and credibility of a banks business model is crucial for its clients and for the market. Mr Benjamin flags that in a world of rising rates, investment banks and wholesale firms are more exposed to market volatility and broad macro-economic shocks than retail and commercial banks are, and do not benefit so directly from higher interest rates. Firms should ensure that their business as it currently exists is operationally resilient before growing or changing significantly, before venturing into new products or markets.</li></ul>Mr Benjamin concluded that firms with a strong clarity of purpose, sufficient regard for the lessons of the past, a healthy dose of humility, and a keen eye to the future will tend to fare the best but only time will tell.",

        "full_text": "New York, July 04, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Reportlinker.com announces the release of the report \"Ruminant Feed Antibiotics Global Market Report 2023\" - https://www.reportlinker.com/p06457434/?utm_source=GNWA., BASF SE, Novartis AG, Eli Lilly &amp; Co., Cargill Incorporated, BASF SE and Koninklijke DSM N.V.\r\nThe global ruminant feed antibiotics market is expected to grow from $4.63 billion in 2022 to $5.02 billion in 2023 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8.40%. The Russia-Ukraine war disrupted the chances of global economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, at least in the short term. The war between these two countries has led to economic sanctions on multiple countries, a surge in commodity pricesand supply chain disruptions, causing inflation across goods and services and affecting many markets across the globe. The ruminant feed antibiotics market is expected to reach $6.77 billion in 2027 at a CAGR of 7.79%.\r\nThe ruminant feed antibiotics market consists of sales of Tetracycline, Penicillin, Sulphonamides, Macrolides, Aminoglycosides, Cephalosporinand Quinolones.Values in this market are factory gate values, that is the value of goods sold by the manufacturers or creators of the goods, whether to other entities (including downstream manufacturers, wholesalers, distributors and retailers) or directly to end customers.\r\nThe value of goods in this market includes related services sold by the creators of the goods.\r\nRuminant feed antibiotics refer to a kind of feed that contains a variety of additives and raw elements.These are used to treat clinical illness, prevent and manage common disease occurrencesand improve animal growth.\r\nThese are classified into three types of uses in animals: therapeutic, prophylacticand subtherapeutic.\r\nAsia-Pacific was the largest region in the ruminant feed antibiotics market in 2022. The regions covered in this report are Asia-Pacific, Western Europe, Eastern Europe, North America, South America, Middle East and Africa.\r\nThe major types of ruminant feed antibiotics are tetracycline, penicillin, sulphonamides, macrolides, aminoglycosides, cephalosporinsand others.Tetracycline refers to medication used to treat bacterial illnesses such as pneumonia and other respiratory tract diseases.\r\nTetracyclines are typically bacteriostaticand their effective use requires a responsive host defense mechanism.Various types of animals include dairy cattle, beef cattleand others.\r\nMajor end-users are dairy farms, veterinary hospitalsand others.\r\nRising demand for dairy products is expected to propel the growth of the ruminant feed antibiotics market going forward.Dairy products are milk and any of the foods made from milk, such as butter, cheese, ice cream, yogurtand condensed and dried milk.\r\nAntibiotics in ruminant feed can improve animal performance, as antibiotics allow farmers to produce more milk with less feed input.Ruminant feed antibiotics are used to promote milk production in dairy cows.\r\nSome antibiotics cause the rumen bacteria colony (one of four stomachs in ruminant cattle) to produce more of the compounds required by cattle for growth. For instance, in February 2022, according to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), a US-based federal executive department for farming, forestry, rural economic developmentand food, milk fat consumption in the United States continued to rise in 2021, with domestic consumption on a milk-fat basis increasing each month compared to the same month in 2020, a total increase of 4.0 billion pounds. Additionally, domestic cheese consumption increased in 2021, reaching 13.0 billion pounds, a 2.7% gain over 2020. Domestic consumption of milk fat and skim milk solids also increased in 2022, by 0.8 billion pounds and 0.9 billion pounds, respectively. Therefore, the rising demand for dairy products is expected to propel the growth of the ruminant feed antibiotics market.\r\nProduct innovations are a key trend gaining popularity in the ruminant feed antibiotics market.Major companies operating in the ruminant feed antibiotics market are focused on developing innovative solutions to strengthen their position in the market.\r\nFor instance, in June 2021, Charoen Pokphand Foods PCL, a Thailand-based agro-industrial and food business, developed a unique feed formulation that comprises microorganisms and enhances farm animals digestive systems through animal food that is suitable for all ages and species of animals.Animals are kept strong and healthy thanks to this probiotic technique without the use of antibiotics or growth hormones.\r\nAdditionally, the substance boosts immunity and shields animals from illness.\r\nIn August 2020, Merck Animal Health (a part of Merck &amp; Co. Inc.), a US-based global healthcare corporation, acquired the worldwide rights to VECOXAN\u00ae (diclazuril) from Elanco Animal Health Inc. for an undisclosed amount. This acquisition of VECOXAN took place for Ruminant Portfolio. It would complement Mercks existing portfolio of veterinary medicines, which includes parasiticides, vaccinationsand servicesand is anticipated to provide a broad range of complementary treatments for its clients. Elanco Animal Health Inc. is a US-based pharmaceutical company that produces medicines and vaccinations for pets and livestock.\r\nThe countries covered in the ruminant feed antibiotics market report are Australia, Brazil, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Japan, Russia, South Korea, UK and USA.\r\nThe market value is defined as the revenues that enterprises gain from the sale of goods and/or services within the specified market and geography through sales, grants, or donations in terms of the currency (in USD, unless otherwise specified).\r\nThe revenues for a specified geography are consumption values that are revenues generated by organizations in the specified geography within the market, irrespective of where they are produced.

The Russia-Ukraine war disrupted the chances of global economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, at least in the short term. The war between these two countries has led to economic sanctions on multiple countries, a surge in commodity pricesand supply chain disruptions, causing inflation across goods and services and affecting many markets across the globe. The ruminant feed antibiotics market is expected to reach $6.77 billion in 2027 at a CAGR of 7.79%.\r\nThe ruminant feed antibiotics market consists of sales of Tetracycline, Penicillin, Sulphonamides, Macrolides, Aminoglycosides, Cephalosporinand Quinolones.Values in this market are factory gate values, that is the value of goods sold by the manufacturers or creators of the goods, whether to other entities (including downstream manufacturers, wholesalers, distributors and retailers) or directly to end customers.\r\nThe value of goods in this market includes related services sold by the creators of the goods.\r\nRuminant feed antibiotics refer to a kind of feed that contains a variety of additives and raw elements.These are used to treat clinical illness, prevent and manage common disease occurrencesand improve animal growth.\r\nThese are classified into three types of uses in animals: therapeutic, prophylacticand subtherapeutic.\r\nAsia-Pacific was the largest region in the ruminant feed antibiotics market in 2022. The regions covered in this report are Asia-Pacific, Western Europe, Eastern Europe, North America, South America, Middle East and Africa.\r\nThe major types of ruminant feed antibiotics are tetracycline, penicillin, sulphonamides, macrolides, aminoglycosides, cephalosporinsand others.Tetracycline refers to medication used to treat bacterial illnesses such as pneumonia and other respiratory tract diseases.\r\nTetracyclines are typically bacteriostaticand their effective use requires a responsive host defense mechanism.Various types of animals include dairy cattle, beef cattleand others.\r\nMajor end-users are dairy farms, veterinary hospitalsand others.\r\nRising demand for dairy products is expected to propel the growth of the ruminant feed antibiotics market going forward.Dairy products are milk and any of the foods made from milk, such as butter, cheese, ice cream, yogurtand condensed and dried milk.\r\nAntibiotics in ruminant feed can improve animal performance, as antibiotics allow farmers to produce more milk with less feed input.Ruminant feed antibiotics are used to promote milk production in dairy cows.\r\nSome antibiotics cause the rumen bacteria colony (one of four stomachs in ruminant cattle) to produce more of the compounds required by cattle for growth. For instance, in February 2022, according to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), a US-based federal executive department for farming, forestry, rural economic developmentand food, milk fat consumption in the United States continued to rise in 2021, with domestic consumption on a milk-fat basis increasing each month compared to the same month in 2020, a total increase of 4.0 billion pounds. Additionally, domestic cheese consumption increased in 2021, reaching 13.0 billion pounds, a 2.7% gain over 2020. Domestic consumption of milk fat and skim milk solids also increased in 2022, by 0.8 billion pounds and 0.9 billion pounds, respectively. Therefore, the rising demand for dairy products is expected to propel the growth of the ruminant feed antibiotics market.\r\nProduct innovations are a key trend gaining popularity in the ruminant feed antibiotics market.Major companies operating in the ruminant feed antibiotics market are focused on developing innovative solutions to strengthen their position in the market.\r\nFor instance, in June 2021, Charoen Pokphand Foods PCL, a Thailand-based agro-industrial and food business, developed a unique feed formulation that comprises microorganisms and enhances farm animals digestive systems through animal food that is suitable for all ages and species of animals.Animals are kept strong and healthy thanks to this probiotic technique without the use of antibiotics or growth hormones.\r\nAdditionally, the substance boosts immunity and shields animals from illness.\r\nIn August 2020, Merck Animal Health (a part of Merck &amp; Co. Inc.), a US-based global healthcare corporation, acquired the worldwide rights to VECOXAN\u00ae (diclazuril) from Elanco Animal Health Inc. for an undisclosed amount. This acquisition of VECOXAN took place for Ruminant Portfolio. It would complement Mercks existing portfolio of veterinary medicines, which includes parasiticides, vaccinationsand servicesand is anticipated to provide a broad range of complementary treatments for its clients. Elanco Animal Health Inc. is a US-based pharmaceutical company that produces medicines and vaccinations for pets and livestock.\r\nThe countries covered in the ruminant feed antibiotics market report are Australia, Brazil, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Japan, Russia, South Korea, UK and USA.\r\nThe market value is defined as the revenues that enterprises gain from the sale of goods and/or services within the specified market and geography through sales, grants, or donations in terms of the currency (in USD, unless otherwise specified).\r\nThe revenues for a specified geography are consumption values that are revenues generated by organizations in the specified geography within the market, irrespective of where they are produced.

        "full_text": "Un bureau international charg\u00e9 d'enqu\u00eater sur le \"crime d'agression\" de la Russie contre l'Ukraine a ouvert \u00e0 La Haye (Pays-Bas) lundi 3 juillet. Selon Kiev, il constitue un premier pas \"historique\" vers la cr\u00e9ation d'un tribunal sp\u00e9cial destin\u00e9 \u00e0 traduire en justice les dirigeants russes responsables de la guerre qui a d\u00e9but\u00e9 en f\u00e9vrier 2022. Ce bureau d'enqu\u00eate nouvellement cr\u00e9\u00e9 soul\u00e8ve plusieurs questions auxquelles franceinfo apporte des r\u00e9ponses.\r\nQui compose ce bureau d'enqu\u00eate ?\r\nCe Centre international pour la poursuite du crime d'agression contre l'Ukraine (ICPA) est une forme de parquet. Il est charg\u00e9 d'enqu\u00eater et de collecter des preuves pour \u00e9tablir les responsabilit\u00e9s civiles et militaires de l'invasion russe. Il regroupe des procureurs de la Cour p\u00e9nale internationale (CPI), mais aussi d'Ukraine, des Etats-Unis et de cinq pays membres de l'Union europ\u00e9enne. Des magistrats des trois Etats baltes (Lettonie, Lituanie et Estonie) participeront ainsi aux enqu\u00eates avec leurs homologues de Pologne et de Roumanie, pr\u00e9cise Le Monde.\r\nCe bureau d'enqu\u00eate est plac\u00e9 sous l'autorit\u00e9 d'Eurojust, l'agence europ\u00e9enne charg\u00e9e de renforcer la coop\u00e9ration judiciaire entre les Etats membres, avec un budget initial de 8,3 millions d'euros, rapporte le Washington Post. \"Eurojust fournit un soutien op\u00e9rationnel, l\u00e9gal, financier et logistique [aux magistrats], notamment pour pr\u00e9server, conserver et analyser les preuves\", ajoute la Commission europ\u00e9enne. L'ICPA est en outre install\u00e9 au si\u00e8ge de l'agence, afin que les procureurs puissent \"travailler ensemble quotidiennement\", selon la Commission.\r\nDe quels dossiers va-t-il s'emparer ?\r\nL'ICPA doit enqu\u00eater sur\u00a0\"la responsabilit\u00e9 du crime d'agression\" de la Russie contre l'Ukraine, a rappel\u00e9 lundi le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral ukrainien, Andriy Kostine, lors d'une conf\u00e9rence de presse. Ce chef d'inculpation correspond, pour la CPI, \u00e0 \"l'emploi par un Etat de la force arm\u00e9e contre la souverainet\u00e9, l'int\u00e9grit\u00e9 territoriale ou l'ind\u00e9pendance politique d'un autre Etat\". Il permet de poursuivre les dirigeants du pays agresseur et est similaire \u00e0 la notion de \"crime contre la paix\", utilis\u00e9e dans les proc\u00e8s de Nuremberg et de Tokyo \u00e0 l'issue la Seconde Guerre mondiale.\r\n\"Si le crime d'agression n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 commis, il n'y aurait pas eu 93 000 autres incidents de crimes de guerre.\"\r\nAndriy Kostine, procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral ukrainienlors d'une conf\u00e9rence de presse\r\nAndriy Kostine a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que 600 personnes sont d\u00e9j\u00e0 suspect\u00e9es d'avoir particip\u00e9 \u00e0 ce crime d'agression, \"dont une partie de la Douma, le Parlement russe\", rapporte RFI. Pour \u00e9tablir ces responsabilit\u00e9s, les magistrats de l'ICPA vont pouvoir rassembler et \u00e9changer des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuves. Le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral adjoint des Etats-Unis, Kenneth Polite, a ainsi annonc\u00e9 que ses services avaient d\u00e9j\u00e0 remis une s\u00e9rie de preuves au bureau d'enqu\u00eate.\r\nLe procureur de la Cour p\u00e9nale internationale, Karim Khan, a salu\u00e9 l'ouverture de l'ICPA, affirmant que c'\u00e9tait la \"premi\u00e8re fois\" que des preuves de crimes de guerre \u00e9taient d\u00e9j\u00e0 r\u00e9unies au cours d'un conflit. L'ICPA ne pourra toutefois pasproduire d'actes de mise en accusation ou de mandats d'arr\u00eats pour les suspect\u00e9s, souligne le Washington Post. Selon le quotidien am\u00e9ricain, l'objectif de ces magistrats est d'appuyer les enqu\u00eates d\u00e9j\u00e0 en cours.\r\nUn tribunal sp\u00e9cial va-t-il \u00eatre cr\u00e9\u00e9\u00a0?\r\nL'ouverture de l'ICPA est \"un signal clair que le monde est uni et inflexible lorsqu'il s'agit de tenir le r\u00e9gime russe responsable de tous ses crimes\", a affirm\u00e9 le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral ukrainien, qualifiant ce moment d'\"historique\". Pour Kiev, ce bureau d'enqu\u00eate est une \u00e9tape cruciale vers la constitution d'un tribunal sp\u00e9cial charg\u00e9 de juger les dirigeants russes, initiative que le pr\u00e9sident Volodymyr Zelensky r\u00e9clame depuis plusieurs mois. Les Etats-Unis soutiennent \u00e9galement la cr\u00e9ation de ce tribunal sp\u00e9cial.\r\nCe projet est cependant encore loin d'aboutir. En premier lieu, car la CPI n'est comp\u00e9tente pour juger un crime d'agression que si le pays qui en est accus\u00e9 est signataire du Statut de Rome, le trait\u00e9 international qui a fond\u00e9 cette juridiction en 2002. Or ce n'est pas le cas de la Russie. Cela n'a toutefois pas emp\u00each\u00e9 la Cour de s'emparer des accusations de crimes de guerre pesant contre Moscou. En mars, la juridiction avait ainsi \u00e9mis un mandat d'arr\u00eat contre Vladimir Poutine, accus\u00e9 d'\u00eatre responsable de la d\u00e9portation d'enfants ukrainiens.\r\nCertains des alli\u00e9s occidentaux de Kiev craignent toutefois que l'initiative d'un tribunal sp\u00e9cial n'obtienne pas le soutien suffisant \u00e0 l'ONU. Ils plaident donc pour la formation d'un tribunal hybride, compos\u00e9 de juges ukrainiens et d'autres nationalit\u00e9s. En attendant que cette question soit tranch\u00e9e, l'ICPA est donc charg\u00e9 de commencer \u00e0 collecter les \u00e9l\u00e9ments des dossiers. \"Pendant que les discussions se poursuivent, (...) il est crucial de s'assurer que les preuves n\u00e9cessaires sont collect\u00e9es et que les investigations puissent d\u00e9buter, rel\u00e8ve la Commission europ\u00e9enne. Ce travail est essentiel pour pr\u00e9parer de futurs proc\u00e8s, que ce soit devant des tribunaux nationaux ou internationaux, y compris un \u00e9ventuel tribunal pour le crime d'agression ou la CPI pour les crimes relevant de sa juridiction.\"",

        "full_text": "NEW YORK, July 04, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WHY:\u00a0Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of securities of Atlas Lithium Corporation f/k/a Brazil Minerals, Inc. (NASDAQ: ATLX, BMIX) between March 25, 2022 and May 3, 2023, both dates inclusive (the Class Period), of the important August 1, 2023 lead plaintiff deadline.\r\nSO WHAT: If you purchased Atlas Lithium securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement.\r\nWHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Atlas Lithium class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=16825 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email pkim@rosenlegal.com or cases@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than August 1, 2023. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.\r\nWHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually handle securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm has achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs Bar. Many of the firms attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.\r\nDETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Atlas Lithium overstated the success of its lithium mining and misrepresented the nature of its Brazilian mineral rights; (2) in connection with these misrepresentations, Atlas Lithium conducted deceptive promotions to artificially inflate the value of the Companys stock; (3) the foregoing conduct was designed to allow its Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and other Company insiders to sell shares back into the market for a profit before the true nature of Atlas Lithiums business was revealed; and (4) as a result, defendants public statements were materially false and/or misleading at all relevant times. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.\r\nTo join the Atlas Lithium class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=16825 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email pkim@rosenlegal.com or cases@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action.\r\nNo Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investors ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.\r\nFollow us for updates on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-rosen-law-firm, on Twitter: https://twitter.com/rosen_firm or on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/rosenlawfirm/.\r\nAttorney Advertising.

        "file_name": "2023-07-04_62392540.txt",
        "full_text": "Humanity's failure to draw down planet-heating carbon dioxide emissions41 billion metric tons in 2022has thrust once-marginal options for capping or reducing CO2 in the atmosphere to center stage in climate policy and investment.\r\nCarbon capture and storage (CCS) and direct air capture (DAC) are both complex industrial processes that isolate CO2 but these newly booming technologies are fundamentally different and often conflated.\r\nHere's a primer on what they are and how they differ.\r\nWhat is carbon capture?\r\nCCS siphons off CO2 from the exhaust, or flue gas, of fossil fuel-fired power plants as well as heavy industry.\r\nThe exhaust from a coal-fired power plant is about 12 percent CO2, while in steel and cement production it is typically double that.\r\nUnlike CCS, which by itself only prevents additional carbon dioxide from entering the atmosphere, DAC extracts CO2 molecules already there.\r\nCrucially, this makes DAC a \"negative emissions\" technology.\r\nIt can therefore generate credits for companies seeking to offset their greenhouse gas outputbut only if the captured CO2 is permanently stored underground, such as in depleted oil and gas reservoirs or in saline aquifers.\r\nThe concentration of carbon dioxide in ambient air is only 420 parts per million (about 0.04 percent), so corralling CO2 using DAC is far more energy intensive.\r\nOnce isolated using either CCS or DAC, CO2 can be used to make products such as building materials or \"green\" aviation fuel, though some of that CO2 will seep back into the air.\r\n\"If the CO2 is utilized, then it is not removal,\" said Oliver Geden, a senior fellow at the German Institute for International Security Affairs.\r\nState of play\r\nThe fossil fuel industry has been using CCS since the 1970s but not to prevent CO2 from leaching into the atmosphere.\r\nRather, oil and gas companies inject CO2 into oil fields to extract more crude more quickly.\r\nHistorically, bolting CCS facilities onto coal- and gas-fired power plants and then storing the CO2 to reduce emissions has proven technically feasible but uneconomical.\r\nThe world's largest CCS plant, the Petra Nova facility in Texas, was mothballed three years after opening in 2017.\r\nBut the looming climate crisis and government subsidies have revived interest in CCS for the power sector and beyond.\r\nAt the end of 2022, there were 35 commercial-scale facilities worldwide applying carbon capture technology to industry, fuel transformation or power generation, isolating a total of 45 million tons (Mt) of CO2, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).\r\nDAC, by contrast, is very new.\r\nA total of 18 DAC plants globally only captured about as much CO2 last year (10,000 tons) as the world emits in 10 seconds.\r\nScaling up\r\nBoth CCS and DAC must be massively scaled up if they are to play a significant role in decarbonising the global economy.\r\nTo keep the mid-century net-zero target in play, CCS will need to divert 1.3 billion tons a year from power and industry30 times more than last yearby 2030, according to the IEA.\r\nDAC must remove 60 Mt CO2 per year by that date, several thousand-fold more than today.\r\nBut the nascent industry is burgeoning with new actors, and the first million-ton-per-year plant is scheduled to come on line in the United States next year, with others following.\r\n\"It's a huge challenge but it's not unprecedented,\" University of WisconsinMadison professor Gregory Nemet told AFP, citing other technologies, including solar panels, that have scaled up dramatically in a matter of decades.\r\nPreparing a site to stock CO2 can take up to 10 years, so storage could become a serious bottleneck for both CCS and DAC development.\r\nCost per ton\r\nCarbon capture costs $15 to $20 per ton for industrial processes with highly concentrated streams of CO2, and $40 to $120 per ton for more diluted gas streams, such as in power generation.\r\nDACstill in its infancyhas much higher costs, ranging today from $600 to $1,000 per ton of CO2 captured.\r\nThose costs are projected to drop sharply to $100-$300 per ton by 2050, according to the inaugural State of Carbon Dioxide Removal report, published earlier this year.\r\nFollow the money\r\nAs countries and companies feel the pinch from decarbonization timetables and net-zero commitments, more moneypublic and privateis flowing toward both CCS and DAC.\r\nIn the United States, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) earmarks billions of dollars in tax credits for CCS.\r\nThe earlier Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act provides about $12 billion over five years.\r\nCanada's 2022 budget also extends an investment tax credit that cuts the cost of CCS projects in half.\r\nSouth Korea and China are also investing heavily in the sector, with China opening a 500,000 Mt plant last month in Jiangsu Province.\r\nIn Europe, support comes at the national level and is oriented toward industry and storage, especially in the North Sea.\r\nFor DAC, a range of companiesAlphabet, Shopify, Meta, Stripe, Microsoft and H&amp;M Grouphave paid into a fund with a promise to collectively buy at least $1 billion of \"permanent carbon removal\" between 2022 and 200.\r\nLast month, JP Morgan struck a $20 million, nine-year carbon removal deal with DAC pioneer Climeworks, based in Switzerland.\r\n\u00a9 2023 AFP\r\nCitation:\r\nCarbon 'capture' climate tech is booming, and confusing (2023, July 4)\r\nretrieved 4 July 2023\r\nfrom

        "full_text": "The global information and communications technologies (ICT) sector drives economic growth, digital transformation, innovation, and global connectivity. However, this growth comes with a price tag. According to a newly published report from Allianz Research, the global ICT sector also emits a significant amount of greenhouse gases, comparable to the aviation industry. In 2020, the ICT sector accounted for 1.8 to 2.8% of global greenhouse gas emissions, which are projected to reach 830 million metric tons of CO2 by 2030. However, the sector's carbon footprint can be reduced through the adoption of renewable energy sources and energy-efficient practices. Reducing the remaining emissions is achievable through the optimization of the product life cycle, involving evaluations of material selection, design decisions, manufacturing, and transportation. \r\nDecarbonizing cryptocurrency is crucial, but blockchain technology-which forms the basis of cryptocurrencies-can also be utilized to support climate action, by enabling transparent tracking of emissions and facilitating a trustworthy Voluntary Carbon Market. \r\nThe majority of emissions in the ICT sector come from user devices, and it is unlikely that consumer behavior will significantly shift toward using fewer devices in the future. Policymakers will likely need to implement regulations or incentives to drive changes in consumer behavior toward reducing emissions from user devices. Therefore, top-down mandates might be necessary to enforce emission reduction measures. \r\nOverall, tackling the carbon footprint of the ICT sector requires a multi-faceted approach, involving renewable energy adoption, energy efficiency improvements, decarbonization of cryptocurrencies, and policy interventions to influence consumer behavior. Allianz takes the topic of reducing the carbon footprint of the ICT sector seriously and is actively involved in various efforts to address this challenge. Stay tuned, more to come soon regarding our measures and actions to drive positive change and contribute to a more sustainable future.",

more energy intensive.\r\nOnce isolated using either CCS or DAC, CO2 can be used to make products such as building materials or \"green\" aviation fuel, though some of that CO2 will seep back into the air.\r\n\"If the CO2 is utilised, then it is not removal,\" said Oliver Geden, a senior fellow at the German Institute for International Security Affairs.\r\nState of play\r\nThe fossil fuel industry has been using CCS since the 1970s but not to prevent CO2 from leaching into the atmosphere.\r\nRather, oil and gas companies inject CO2 into oil fields to extract more crude more quickly.\r\nHistorically, bolting CCS facilities onto coal- and gas-fired power plants and then storing the CO2 to reduce emissions has proven technically feasible but uneconomical.\r\nThe world's largest CCS plant, the Petra Nova facility in Texas, was mothballed three years after opening in 2017.\r\nBut the looming climate crisis and government subsidies have revived interest in CCS for the power sector and beyond.\r\nAt the end of 2022, there were 35 commercial-scale facilities worldwide applying carbon capture technology to industry, fuel transformation or power generation, isolating a total of 45 million tonnes (Mt) of CO2, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).\r\nDAC, by contrast, is very new.\r\nA total of 18 DAC plants globally only captured about as much CO2 last year (10,000 tonnes) as the world emits in 10 seconds.\r\nScaling up\r\nBoth CCS and DAC must be massively scaled up if they are to play a significant role in decarbonising the global economy.\r\nTo keep the mid-century net-zero target in play, CCS will need to divert 1.3 billion tonnes a year from power and industry \u2014 30 times more than last year \u2014 by 2030, according to the IEA.\r\nDAC must remove 60 Mt CO2 per year by that date, several thousand-fold more than today.\r\nBut the nascent industry is burgeoning with new actors, and the first million-tonne-per-year plant is scheduled to come on line in the United States next year, with others following.\r\n\"It's a huge challenge but it's not unprecedented,\" University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison professor Gregory Nemet told AFP, citing other technologies, including solar panels, that have scaled up dramatically in a matter of decades.\r\nPreparing a site to stock CO2 can take up to 10 years, so storage could become a serious bottleneck for both CCS and DAC development.\r\nCost per tonne\r\nCarbon capture costs $15 to $20 per tonne for industrial processes with highly concentrated streams of CO2, and $40 to $120 per tonne for more diluted gas streams, such as in power generation.\r\nDAC \u2014 still in its infancy \u2014 has much higher costs, ranging today from $600 to $1,000 per tonne of CO2 captured.\r\nThose costs are projected to drop sharply to $100-$300 per tonne by 2050, according to the inaugural State of Carbon Dioxide Removal report, published earlier this year.\r\nFollow the money\r\nAs countries and companies feel the pinch from decarbonisation timetables and net-zero commitments, more money \u2014 public and private \u2014 is flowing toward both CCS and DAC.\r\nIn the United States, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) earmarks billions of dollars in tax credits for CCS.\r\nThe earlier Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act provides about $12 billion over five years.\r\nCanada's 2022 budget also extends an investment tax credit that cuts the cost of CCS projects in half.\r\nSouth Korea and China are also investing heavily in the sector, with China opening a 500,000 Mt plant last month in Jiangsu Province.\r\nIn Europe, support comes at the national level and is oriented toward industry and storage, especially in the North Sea.\r\nFor DAC, a range of companies \u2014 Alphabet, Shopify, Meta, Stripe, Microsoft and H&amp;M Group \u2014 have paid into a fund with a promise to collectively buy at least $1 billion of \"permanent carbon removal\" between 2022 and 200.\r\nLast

Du 5 au 9 juillet, le collectif paralysera une infrastructure-cl\u00e9 dEngie pour exiger davantage de justice climatique et sociale. Pour ces activistes, la d\u00e9sob\u00e9issance civile est devenue une arme ultime.\r\nFin du monde, fin du mois\u00a0: m\u00eame combat. En Belgique, comme ailleurs, la convergence des luttes climatiques et sociales se mat\u00e9rialise au travers de multiples mobilisations depuis des mois. Cest dans cette lign\u00e9e que sinscrit Code Rouge, un mouvement de d\u00e9sob\u00e9issance civile, avec sa nouvelle action #BlockEngie. Durant quatre jours, du 5 au 9 juillet, des centaines de militants prendront part \u00e0 cette protestation massive contre le g\u00e9ant \u00e9nerg\u00e9tique fran\u00e7ais. Concr\u00e8tement, un des sites-cl\u00e9s dEngie tenu secret pour maintenir l\u2019effet de surprise sera paralys\u00e9 d\u00e8s mercredi apr\u00e8s-midi, et ce, durant pr\u00e8s de 90 heures.\r\n\u00ab\u00a0Engie est lentreprise la plus \u00e9mettrice de CO2 en Belgique, donc cest un symbole important pour une action comme Code Rouge\u00a0\u00bb, explique Morgane, porte-parole de la plateforme soutenue par diff\u00e9rentes organisations telles que Greenpeace, Extinction Rebellion ou le R\u00e9seau wallon de lutte contre la pauvret\u00e9. En continuant \u00e0 investir dans l\u00e9nergie fossile, Engie \u00ab empoisonne le climat\u00a0\u00bb et \u00ab\u00a0emp\u00eache la r\u00e9volution \u00e9nerg\u00e9tique\u00a0\u00bb, accuse le collectif. Outre les d\u00e9g\u00e2ts environnementaux, Code Rouge d\u00e9nonce \u00e9galement les surprofits engrang\u00e9s par lentreprise fran\u00e7aise durant la crise \u00e9nerg\u00e9tique. \u00ab\u00a0Engie senfuit avec notre argent. En 2022, alors que des millions de Belges voyaient leur facture exploser, le groupe a vers\u00e9 \u00e0 ses actionnaires 3,4 milliards de dividendes\u00a0!\u00a0\u00bb. Enfin, le collectif pointe les risques sanitaires induits par le maintien en activit\u00e9 de r\u00e9acteurs nucl\u00e9aires obsol\u00e8tes. \u00ab\u00a0Engie met nos vies en danger.\u00a0\u00bb\r\nSi lorganisation reste discr\u00e8te sur son modus operandi, lobjectif est denrayer au maximum le fonctionnement des activit\u00e9s dEngie durant ces quatre jours. Les 8 et 9 octobre 2022, les activistes de Code Rouge \u00e9taient parvenus \u00e0 bloquer deux sites de Total Energies, \u00e0 Feluy (Hainaut) et Wandre (Li\u00e8ge), en neutralisant des points dacc\u00e8s, en sencha\u00eenant aux grilles dentr\u00e9e ou encore en envahissant les voies ferr\u00e9es aux abords des infrastructures. Des actions similaires seront certainement d\u00e9ploy\u00e9es d\u00e8s mercredi. Mais le collectif insiste\u00a0: la s\u00e9curit\u00e9, tant des participants que des forces de lordre, est primordiale. \u00ab\u00a0Nous ne mettrons personne en danger et respecterons lint\u00e9grit\u00e9 physique de chacun et chacune\u00a0\u00bb, assure la porte-parole.\r\nPar cette action, Code Rouge entend aussi d\u00e9noncer le \u00ab\u00a0greenwashing\u00a0\u00bb dEngie. \u00ab Lentreprise accorde beaucoup de moyens pour se donner une image verte, mais dans les faits, elle continue dinvestir dans les \u00e9nergies fossiles, ce qui va tout \u00e0 fait \u00e0 lencontre dune transition \u00e9nerg\u00e9tique durable, d\u00e9plore Morgane. Nous voulons rappeler aux citoyens et citoyennes cette face dEngie.\u00a0\u00bb\r\n\u00ab\u00a0En enfreignant d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9ment les lois, nous nous inscrivons dans une longue histoire de luttes sociales.\u00bb\r\nLaction est dirig\u00e9e vers les instances dirigeantes d\u2019Engie, et non pas vers les travailleurs du secteur \u00ab\u00a0qui d\u00e9pendent de leur emploi pour sassurer un revenu\u00a0\u00bb, insiste Code Rouge. \u00ab\u00a0Le personnel a \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9 de notre mobilisation, explique la porte-parole. Nous avons eu des contacts avec les syndicats et nous leur avons bien expliqu\u00e9 que notre d\u00e9marche ne les visait pas directement.\u00a0\u00bb\r\nDe son c\u00f4t\u00e9, la direction dEngie anticipe les perturbations \u00e9ventuelles. \u00abPour chacun de nos sites, nous avons pris de mesures sp\u00e9cifiques afin dassurer, dune part, la continuit\u00e9 de nos op\u00e9rations pour \u00eatre en mesure de poursuivre lapprovisionnement de nos clients et, dautre part, la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 des personnes et des installations\u00a0\u00bb. Si lentreprise dit vouloir respecter \u00ab\u00a0la libert\u00e9 de manifester\u00a0\u00bb, elle r\u00e9fute les arguments avanc\u00e9s par Code Rouge. \u00ab\u00a0Leurs affirmations ne sont pas correctes\u00a0\u00bb, commente le porte-parole du groupe, qui rappelle les efforts entrepris pour rendre les activit\u00e9s globalement neutres en carbone dici 2045. \u00ab Depuis 2017, les \u00e9missions mondiales de gaz \u00e0 effet de serre dEngie ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 diminu\u00e9 de 33 %.\u00a0Nous mettons tout en uvre pour acc\u00e9l\u00e9rer la transition vers une \u00e9conomie neutre en carbone, par des solutions plus sobres en \u00e9nergie et plus respectueuses de lenvironnement.\u00a0\u00bb\u00a0\u00a0\r\nAux yeux des militants de Code Rouge, la d\u00e9sob\u00e9issance civile est devenue indispensable pour faire entendre des revendications et concr\u00e9tiser les changements. \u00ab Dautres actions ont \u00e9t\u00e9 men\u00e9es par le pass\u00e9 pour sensibiliser \u00e0 ces th\u00e9matiques, en vain, regrette Morgane. On a vu des manifestations, des p\u00e9titions, des rencontres avec des ministres, des occupations aux si\u00e8ges de partis politiques pour essayer de faire bouger les choses, mais le constat est l\u00e0\u00a0: rien ne bouge pas vraiment, ou en tout cas pas assez vite. Donc il est temps de passer \u00e0 la vitesse sup\u00e9rieure.\u00a0\u00bb Et lorganisation de rappeler\u00a0: \u00ab\u00a0En enfreignant d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9ment les lois, nous nous inscrivons dans une longue histoire de luttes sociales (). Les grands changements dans le monde ont souvent eu lieu apr\u00e8s des actes massifs de d\u00e9sob\u00e9issance civile.\u00a0\u00bb\r\nAlors que l\u2019action contre Total Energiesavait rassembl\u00e9e environ 1.200 protestataires, l\u2019organisation s\u2019attend cette fois \u00e0 une mobilisation l\u00e9g\u00e8rement plus faible, en raison du moment choisi (jours de semaine et p\u00e9riode estivale). Plusieurs centaines de personnes devraient tout de m\u00eame faire le d\u00e9placement jusqu\u2019au site d\u2019Engie, dont l\u2019emplacement sera r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 au grand public mercredi apr\u00e8s-midi.",

It can therefore generate credits for companies seeking to offset their greenhouse gas output -- but only if the captured CO2 is permanently stored underground, such as in depleted oil and gas reservoirs or in saline aquifers.\r\nThe concentration of carbon dioxide in ambient air is only 420 parts per million (about 0.04 percent), so corralling CO2 using DAC is far more energy intensive.\r\nOnce isolated using either CCS or DAC, CO2 can be used to make products such as building materials or \"green\" aviation fuel, though some of that CO2 will seep back into the air. \r\n\"If the CO2 is utilised, then it is not removal,\" said Oliver Geden, a senior fellow at the German Institute for International Security Affairs.\r\nState of play\r\nThe fossil fuel industry has been using CCS since the 1970s but not to prevent CO2 from leaching into the atmosphere. \r\nRather, oil and gas companies inject CO2 into oil fields to extract more crude more quickly. \r\nHistorically, bolting CCS facilities onto coal- and gas-fired power plants and then storing the CO2 to reduce emissions has proven technically feasible but uneconomical. \r\nThe world's largest CCS plant, the Petra Nova facility in Texas, was mothballed three years after opening in 2017.\r\nBut the looming climate crisis and government subsidies have revived interest in CCS for the power sector and beyond.\r\nAt the end of 2022, there were 35 commercial-scale facilities worldwide applying carbon capture technology to industry, fuel transformation or power generation, isolating a total of 45 million tonnes (Mt) of CO2, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). \r\nDAC, by contrast, is very new. \r\nA total of 18 DAC plants globally only captured about as much CO2 last year (10,000 tonnes) as the world emits in 10 seconds.\r\nScaling up\r\nBoth CCS and DAC must be massively scaled up if they are to play a significant role in decarbonising the global economy.\r\nTo keep the mid-century net-zero target in play, CCS will need to divert 1.3 billion tonnes a year from power and industry -- 30 times more than last year -- by 2030, according to the IEA. \r\nDAC must remove 60 Mt CO2 per year by that date, several thousand-fold more than today. \r\nBut the nascent industry is burgeoning with new actors, and the first million-tonne-per-year plant is scheduled to come on line in the United States next year, with others following. \r\n\"It's a huge challenge but it's not unprecedented,\" University of Wisconsin-Madison professor Gregory Nemet told AFP, citing other technologies, including solar panels, that have scaled up dramatically in a matter of decades.\r\nPreparing a site to stock CO2 can take up to 10 years, so storage could become a serious bottleneck for both CCS and DAC development. \r\nCost per tonne\r\nCarbon capture costs $15 to $20 per tonne for industrial processes with highly concentrated streams of CO2, and $40 to $120 per tonne for more diluted gas streams, such as in power generation. \r\nDAC -- still in its infancy -- has much higher costs, ranging today from $600 to $1,000 per tonne of CO2 captured.\r\nThose costs are projected to drop sharply to $100-$300 per tonne by 2050, according to the inaugural State of Carbon Dioxide Removal report, published earlier this year.\r\nFollow the money\r\nAs countries and companies feel the pinch from decarbonisation timetables and net-zero commitments, more money -- public and private -- is flowing toward both CCS and DAC.\r\nIn the United States, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) earmarks billions of dollars in tax credits for CCS.\r\nThe earlier Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act provides about $12 billion over five years. \r\nCanada's 2022 budget also extends an investment tax credit that cuts the cost of CCS projects in half.\r\nSouth Korea and China are also investing heavily in the sector, with China opening a 500,000 Mt plant last month in Jiangsu Province.\r\nIn Europe, support comes at the national level and is oriented toward industry and storage, especially in the North Sea.\r\nFor DAC, a range of companies -- Alphabet, Shopify, Meta, Stripe, Microsoft and H&amp;M Group -- have paid into a fund with a promise to collectively buy at least $1 billion of \"permanent carbon removal\" between 2022 and 200.\r\nLast month, JP Morgan struck a $20 million, nine-year carbon removal deal with DAC pioneer Climeworks, based in Switzerland.\r\nDon\u2019t miss out on ET Prime stories!

\r\nBoth CCS and DAC must be massively scaled up if they are to play a significant role in decarbonising the global economy.\r\nTo keep the mid-century net-zero target in play, CCS will need to divert 1.3 billion tonnes a year from power and industry -- 30 times more than last year -- by 2030, according to the IEA. \r\nDAC must remove 60 Mt CO2 per year by that date, several thousand-fold more than today. \r\nBut the nascent industry is burgeoning with new actors, and the first million-tonne-per-year plant is scheduled to come on line in the United States next year, with others following. \r\n\"It's a huge challenge but it's not unprecedented,\" University of WisconsinMadison professor Gregory Nemet told AFP, citing other technologies, including solar panels, that have scaled up dramatically in a matter of decades.\r\nPreparing a site to stock CO2 can take up to 10 years, so storage could become a serious bottleneck for both CCS and DAC development. \r\n- Cost per tonne - \r\nCarbon capture costs $15 to $20 per tonne for industrial processes with highly concentrated streams of CO2, and $40 to $120 per tonne for more diluted gas streams, such as in power generation. \r\nDAC -- still in its infancy -- has much higher costs, ranging today from $600 to $1,000 per tonne of CO2 captured.\r\nThose costs are projected to drop sharply to $100-$300 per tonne by 2050, according to the inaugural State of Carbon Dioxide Removal report, published earlier this year.\r\nFollow the money\r\nAs countries and companies feel the pinch from decarbonisation timetables and net-zero commitments, more money -- public and private -- is flowing toward both CCS and DAC.\r\nIn the United States, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) earmarks billions of dollars in tax credits for CCS.\r\nThe earlier Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act provides about $12 billion over five years. \r\nCanada's 2022 budget also extends an investment tax credit that cuts the cost of CCS projects in half.\r\nSouth Korea and China are also investing heavily in the sector, with China opening a 500,000 Mt plant last month in Jiangsu Province.\r\nIn Europe, support comes at the national level and is oriented toward industry and storage, especially in the North Sea.\r\nFor DAC, a range of companies -- Alphabet, Shopify, Meta, Stripe, Microsoft and H&amp;M Group -- have paid into a fund with a promise to collectively buy at least $1 billion of \"permanent carbon removal\" between 2022 and 200.\r\nLast month, JP Morgan struck a $20 million, nine-year carbon removal deal with DAC pioneer Climeworks, based in Switzerland. \r\n\u00a9 2023 AFP",

        "full_text": "In what union members called a \"huge victory for workers,\" an administrative judge with the National Labor Relations Board has ruled that coffee giant Starbucks violated federal labor law by terminating organized workers in several Pittsburgh locations, accusing the company of orchestrating a \"purge\" of employees leading the unionization effort.\r\nThe ruling by Judge Robert A. Ringler found that the company and local store managers in Pittsburgh abused their power and unlawfully targeted workers organizing with Pittsburgh Starbucks Workers United. As part of the decision, Ringler ordered the company to reinstate four fired workers and compensate any employees who lost income due to the illegal labor practices.\r\nNoting how the specific union members were consistently treated differently than other non-union employees and ultimately fired, Ringler said in his ruling that a \"repeated pattern of unlawful activity abundantly demonstrates a casual relationship between their firings and union activities.\"\r\nThree of the fired workers were part of the union's 5-member bargaining unit, a fact that Ringler suggested was not a coincidence. \"Starbucks fired 3 of the 5 members of the Union's effects bargaining team,\" he said in the ruling. \"This appears to be less than coincidental. Or put another way, a whopping 60% firing rate for the effects bargaining team seems more like a purge than an evenhanded practice.\"\r\nTori Tambellini, one of the workers fired by Starbucks, applauded the judge's ruling. \"I absolutely cannot wait to be back on the shop floor with my coworkers, fighting for the contract we deserve,\" Tambellini said Monday.\r\nStarbucks Workers United, the national union behind the push to organize the stores, said the 50-page ruling by Judge Robert A. Ringler \"exposes the ludicrous and simply implausible excuses Starbucks has used to justify their union-busting actions. It also shows just how far the company is willing to go to stop workers from organizing, and just how scared of their own workers this company is.\"\r\nAccording toMashed:\r\nStarbucks' Pittsburgh union alleged that the Starbucks corporation and shift supervisors abused their power and interrogated, threatened, and unjustly terminated members of the union. Supervisors allegedly stated that union members would lose their benefits, be barred from transferring stores, and would be deprived of shift assistance during rush hours. The supervisors also engaged in unlawful surveillance to determine which employees were working with the union.\r\nAs workers at Starbucks stores nationwide have racked up organizing victories, the company has been hit numerous times with NLRB rulings that found unlawful labor practices.\r\n\"Not even a multi-billion dollar corporation like Starbucks is above the law,\" Starbucks Workers United tweeted Monday night. \"Workers are fighting back against Starbucks' illegal union-busting campaign and are WINNING. This ruling is just one step in our campaign to hold Starbucks accountable.\"\r\n\"Time is ticking, Starbucks and the longer you continue your anti-union crusade,\" the union added, \"the more the public will learn about your truly heinous actions against workers. It's not too late to stop this now, do the right thing, and come to the bargaining table in good faith.\"",

        "full_text": "Having collaborated once in 2020, Gogoro and MUJI, a global Japanese retail company known for its philosophy of designing quality, ergonomic products with minimalist aesthetics, are teaming up again to launch the \"Recycling for Good\" initiative. This joint sustainability project paves the way for a new co-branded Gogoro Smartscooter, which will be released this year, integrating sustainable thinking and minimalist design.\r\n\"Recycling for Good\" - A Joint Sustainability Initiative\r\nGogoro's vision on sustainability aligns with MUJI's core philosophy of giving back to the Earth. In response to this year's World Environment Day theme #BeatPlasticPollution, Gogoro has joined MUJI in encouraging the public to recycle more through the \"Recycling for Good\" initiative. By creating opportunities for the public to participate in recycling PP (polypropylene) plastic waste, Gogoro and MUJI aim to empower individuals to take small actions towards a more sustainable future. The project also serves as a prelude to the upcoming design collaboration on a co-branded Smartscooter.\r\nConsumers can bring their used plastic bottles and containers made of PP material to select Gogoro and MUJI stores across Taiwan. Participants can check in by scanning a QR code at designated recycling bins and provide their information to receive a limited edition ruler made from recycled materials. All PP plastic collected at Gogoro stores will be revitalized and transformed into reusable materials, to be incorporated into the production of new Smartscooter products.\r\nTransformative Power to Create Positive Change\r\nGogoro was founded in 2011 to address the transportation challenges cities are facing, with a breakthrough approach to smarter vehicles and electric refueling. With more than 2.5 million riders1, over 670,000 tons2 of CO2 has successfully been saved. Gogoro has revolutionized the way people utilize and share energy, leading the change toward a more sustainable future in cities worldwide.\r\nIn addition to Gogoro's urban energy and transportation transformation, Gogoro is also committed to a cleaner planet through the product design. From the launch of the very first Smartscooter, the Gogoro 1 Series, Gogoro has integrated the use of 100% recyclable Polypropylene (PP) as a material for select parts. This deliberate choice reflects a commitment to promote the utilization of reusable and recyclable resources throughout the Gogoro product line.\r\nAdditionally, since 2022, Gogoro has achieved 40% renewable energy3 usage in its manufacturing processes, using a mix of solar and wind energy. At select retail store, 100% renewable energy has been implemented as Gogoro moes towards the goal of achieving a 100% renewable energy mix4.",

        "full_text": "6/23/2000 - Lack of UpdatesSorry about the lack of updates since early May. May and June have been extremely busy for me, and I haven't been able to give the site the attention it needs and deserves. I am doing some minor list updates, and have been redesigning the site to make it a little easier to navigate. This isn't my best design work, I promise. I made the site like this as function over form to start. I am gathering contact people for the first petition email. I have been talking with the people at Sendmail, Inc, and that have been interested in seeing what you folks have to say about their decision to only support Red Hat. I saw something funny yesterday... Dell's online ordering system will let you buy \"Linux 6.2\"... I was thinking this must be some new distribution or maybe they got the kernel version wrong, but then a light went off... Silly me, they meant Red Hat 6.2! Doh!\r\n 5/2/2000 - Minor UpdatesI have added a few companies to the various lists, made some spelling corrections, and added the Petition Distribution Breakdown. Thanks to everyone who has sent emails concerning corrections, suggestions, opinions, etc... Keep them coming. I will be doing some major updates in the near future.\r\n4/28/2000 - Update #2Thanks to Tim Riker for pointing out that RPM is not RedHat Package Manager but rather RPM Package Manager. Seems a bit recursive if you ask me ;-) But on the official RPM FAQ It does list it as such. Seems like traffic is dying down a little. I guess it's a good thing, in that we'll have less people trying to be distruptive. I have about 5-10 vendors to update, and hope to do so this weekend. Thanks for stopping by.\r\n4/28/2000 - Heavy Traffic and moreAs you can imagine with over 30,000 people visiting us in the last 12 hours, we have gotten a log of email. If you have sent us mail, and you haven't gotten a reply, we will do our best to reply to all the emails sent. From what we have read, there have been some very good suggestions, additions to our list, and outright anger to to what we're doing. A lot of email has been sent about VA Linux, and our placing them on the Red Hat only list. I know they support the development of Debian and run Debian on their web server, but when you buy something through their web site, currently you can only get Red Hat. I have a call in to them to confirm that we're not just blind and not seeing other distributions. Thank you for your zeal in response to our efforts. On a more disappointing side, someone thought it would be cute to write a program to continually vote for their favourite distribution, which is why the poll went away. Please check back often as we are updating the page through out the day.\r\n4/27/2000 (5:00pm Update) - We've been /.'edWell we have just been posted on Slashdot, and from the comments I am seeing, I only ask that you Read before you Roast, as it seems many don't understand the context of the domain name, and the name of our Effort.\r\n4/27/2000 - Linux.Com, Geeknews.org Report on RedHatIsNotLinux.orgThanks to Linux.com and Geeknews.org for reporting on our efforts here. I think it shows a true effort to show journalistic integrity on the part of Linux.com to list us, as VA is on our Red Hat Only List. Kudos to them!\r\n4/18/2000 - redhatisnotlinux.org seeks volunteersWe are currently looking for volunteers to help compile our different lists. If you are interested in helping us out, please let us know at info@redhatisnotlinux.org.\r\n4/16/2000 - redhatisnotlinux.org goes liveIn an attempt to gain support for other distributions of GNU/Linux, redhatisnotlinux.org is established. We're currently filling out our database of products that support Linux, both distribution specific and distribution non-specific. It is our hope to show the disproportionate amount of support for Red Hat over ALL other Distributions. If you find any errors on this site, please report them to info@redhatisnotlinux.org. Please not our purpose is to point out commercial support. We are well aware of the community activity focused around other distributions.\r\nReturn to Top\r\nIf this is not an Anti-Red Hat Linux site, what is it?This is an attempt to call attention to the fact that companies who are writing commercial applications for Linux are ignoring part of the professional GNU/Linux community, which does not use Red Hat Linux.What do you mean \"Red Hat Is Not Linux\"The easiest way to explain this is to create some definitions or premises, and then come up with a result:\r\nLinux, as defined by CmdrTaco of Slashdot is: \r\n \"the GNU license operating system created by Linus Torvalds and the rest of the internet. Unix-like and free, it powers power systems maintained by power users.\"\r\nLinux as we define it is the kernel of the GNU/Linux OS and various Distributions.\r\nA Distribution of the GNU/Linux OS, of which Red Hat is one (and the most popular in the media), is the packaging of the Linux kernel, utilities, and programs to make a usable operating system, which can be installed on any number of computers.\r\nThis is how we first of all derive that 1) Red Hat != GNU/Linux, and 2) Red Hat is a Distribution of GNU/Linux.\r\nBecause of the fragementation of commands, security methodologies, package management, and file layouts among distributions, we feel it is not in the best interest of GNU/Linux to consider one Distribution, and its way of doing things as \"Linux.\"\r\nWhat do you hope to accomplish by this?Better support by commercial vendors for GNU/Linux, not just Red Hat Linux and support for GNU/Linux hardware platforms other than Intel based chipsets (PPC, Alpha, etc).\r\nWhy do you think that commercial vendors ignore GNU/Linux?A majority of applications being written today are not distribution independent. Not only are companies developing solely for Red Hat Linux, they are not aware that other distributions exist.\r\nI'm not convinced, but how do you expect your goals to be accomplished?Our main goal is to point out incompatibilities between distributions, as well as to provide a petition facility for non-Red Hat users to voice their distress with the continued trend of software that only supports Red Hat. By doing so, we hope that enough attention can be created for our cause that commercial vendors would consider support for Linux as a whole, not just Red Hat Linux, including all major distributions and binary platforms (x86, PPC, Alpha, etc).\r\nWhat's With This GNU/Linux Stuff Anyway?There is a political issue in the Linux community as to the relevance of GNU to Linux. Our position is that without GNU and their tools such as GCC, Linux would not be a mainstream operating system. We feel that indeed GNU has done more for Linux than Red Hat has, as I am sure Red Hat themselves would admit. We refer to GNU/Linux in respect to the importance and impact GNU has on Linux.\r\nBack to Top",

The signing of the agreement is an extension to the collaboration between the two power sector industrial companies that started in July 1986.\r\nThe agreement signing ceremony was attended by Dr. Nalin Shinghal, Chairman &amp; Managing Director, BHEL; Mr. Jai Prakash Srivastava, Director (Engineering, Research &amp; Development) &amp; Director (Finance - Addl. Charge) BHEL; Mrs. Renuka Gera, Director Industrial Systems &amp; Products, BHEL; Mr. Deepesh Nanda, CEO, GE Gas Power South Asia and President &amp; CEO, GE Aero-derivative Business, Gas Power Asia and other senior officials from GE and BHEL. Mr. Theodoros Stamatiadis, Executive Counsel (IP), GE Power also participated in the meeting virtually.\r\nThrough this agreement, GE Vernova's Gas Power business will continue to strengthen BHEL's capabilities to offer best-in-class gas turbine technology and help meet the power plant requirements of customers. Till date, BHEL has supplied about 230 GE gas turbines to various oil refineries, process industries, and utilities in India and overseas. The above cooperation is also contributing towards reshaping India's energy roadmap by promoting indigenous manufacturing capabilities, creating new job opportunities, and expanding the supply chain network. It is a testimony to Atmanirbhar Bharat (Self-reliant India) and Make In India initiatives, and also aligned with India's Power Vision.\r\n\"BHEL has been providing innovative technological solutions in the power sector and embracing collaborations built on values of trust and commitment towards creating a more sustainable ecosystem. Our long-term association with GE helped us in building a robust energy value chain, offering a comprehensive portfolio of gas turbine powering solutions, and setting new industry benchmarks, while we look forward to achieving new milestones in the energy sector. With the new agreement, we will also be able to offer hybrid powering solutions by using GE's aero-derivative gas turbine technology and support the growth of renewable energy in India.\" said Mr. Jai Prakash Srivastava, Director (Engineering, Research &amp; Development) &amp; Director (Finance - Addl. Charge) BHEL.\r\n\"Over the decades, GE is helping to address global challenges in the energy sector by offering innovative and disruptive technology that can drive energy transition forward and helping nations to reduce emissions in the power sector in more than one ways. Both GE and BHEL have created a strong legacy of providing integrated solutions to the power plant owners - delivering higher efficiency, reliability and availability of the gas turbine units. We can together bring a significant shift to reduce emissions in the gas power sector, especially in India.\" said Mr. Deepesh Nanda, CEO, GE Gas Power South Asia.\r\nIndia's focus to achieve net zero emissions and include green hydrogen into the energy mix would need future ready powering technology. Today, GE has 120+ gas turbines supporting power generation with hydrogen blends and associated fuels around the world and the fleet has accumulated more than 8.5 million operating hours. GE's gas turbine portfolio, including the B- and E-class, has the capability to burn hydrogen levels from 5% (by volume) up to 100%. This capability varies depending on the type of combustion system used. At the same time, gas-based power can also provide a cleaner base load power as compared to coal-fired power generation, at the grid level, to the growing base of intermittent renewable energy in India. As per the agreement, the BHEL customers can now have access to GE's advanced gas turbines that are capable of burning blends of hydrogen, methanol, syngas and other low BTU fuels, contributing further towards accelerating energy transition in India and region at large.\r\nAdditionally, GE and BHEL are providing comprehensive engineering, repairs and maintenance services to the gas power plant operators in the region. These services are offered by BHEL-GE Gas Turbine Services (BGGTS) Private Limited, a 50:50 joint venture between GE and BHEL. Established in 1997 and located in Hyderabad, BGGTS is synergizing advanced class gas turbine technology with local engineering capability.\r\nAbout GE Gas Power:\r\nGE Gas Power is a world leader in natural gas power technology, services, and solutions.

Cohan. \"To a lesser degree, I see problems occurring at companies such as Comcast (controlled by the Roberts family) and Paramount Global (controlled by Shari Redstone), among others. When dual classes of stock are involved, a familys voting power often far outstrips its economic ownership, leading to financially foolish, and even bizarre, behavior.\"\r\nALSO IN THE NEWS: Former DOJ official: Indictment for Trump's alleged election crimes will be a much bigger deal than the docs scandal\r\nAmerican corporations turned to professional management a century ago to insulate shareholders from dynastic owners, and the Smartmatic defamation suit may finally break Murdoch's grip on the conservative media empire he controls.\r\n\"One way to rein in Mr. Murdoch may lie with Smartmatic,\" wrote Cohan. \"If it emerges victorious in its lawsuit, it could insist, as part of any settlement, on governance changes at Fox or even demand that the CEO succession process include candidates outside the Murdoch family. Smartmatic, or even the recently filed shareholder lawsuit against Fox, could end up pressuring Fox, and indirectly News Corp, to scrap their dual-class stock structures.\"\r\nMurdoch may be 92 years old, but his control of Fox and other media entities remains absolute.\r\n\"Rupert Murdoch has had absolute power at both Fox and News Corp for far too long,\" Cohan wrote. \"Thats dangerous under any circumstances, but its especially troubling at a national news organization, such as Fox, where disinformation and lies, apparently, are the coin of the realm. And there doesnt seem to be any way that will change if the Murdochs maintain their absolute power and absolute control. That fact alone further imperils what has become Americas fragile democracy.\"",

We believe large-scale IT hardware manufacturing will help in broadening and deepening the manufacturing ecosystem,\" he added.\r\n HPE said it has its largest workforce outside the United States in India, while its largest campus in the world at Mahadevapura in Bengaluru is home to many of HPEs worldwide product development resources. More than 4,000 of HPEs most distinguished scientists, engineers, and research teams are based out of HPEs R&amp;D hub at this campus.\r\n The decision to start manufacturing from India underscores HPEs long-term commitment to India,\" said Som Satsangi, SVP and managing director at HPE India.\r\n India is expected to grow into a $1 trillion digital economy, and we believe that Make in India will help accelerate this vision. With local manufacturing, HPE will be able to better serve the needs of our customers across industries and segments, from startups to SMBs to enterprise to government,\" he added.\r\n This is the second time HPE is investing into India.

        "full_text": "(Bloomberg) -- Meta Platforms Inc.s Facebook lost its European Union court fight over a German antitrust order that homed in on the US tech firms power to cash-in on a vast trove of users data.\r\nMost Read from Bloomberg\r\nThe EUs Court of Justice ruled that Germanys Federal Cartel Office didnt overstep its powers in 2019 when it ordered Facebook to overhaul how it tracks its users internet browsing and smartphone apps. The move followed a groundbreaking antitrust probe that simultaneously looked into Facebooks alleged violations of the EUs strict data protection rules.\r\nTuesdays case at the top EU court has been seen as a test of how far European antitrust regulators can go to make sure Silicon Valley firms dont mishandle massive data sets gleaned from users to cement their market power.\r\nThe judgment will have far-reaching effects on the business models of the data economy, said Andreas Mundt, head of the Federal Cartel Office. Data is a decisive factor in establishing market power. The use of personal data of consumers by large internet companies can be abusive under antitrust law.\r\nMeta is facing EU scrutiny on multiple fronts, being subject to national and European Commission antitrust investigations, as well as data-protection probes. In May, Meta was hit by a record 1.2 billion ($1.3 billion) EU privacy fine and given a deadline to stop shipping users data to the US after regulators said it failed to protect personal information from the American security services.\r\nIn Tuesdays EU case, Meta accused the German antitrust regulator last year of unlawfully conflating data protection and antitrust law to seek an unprecedented overhaul of the firms business model.\r\nWhen competition watchdogs are looking at potential abuses of market dominance by the likes of Meta, they can also point to violations of the EUs General Data Protection Regulation, the Luxembourg-based EU court ruled. In such cases antitrust agencies must cooperate with other authorities, the court added.\r\nRead More: Meta Hit With EU Antitrust Charges Over Marketplace Service\r\nA German court sought the EU tribunals view on the scope of the blocs rules in the case, which constituted a novel approach by regulators to use an antitrust probe to also tackle data privacy concerns.\r\nThe company said it is evaluating the EU courts decision and will have more to say in due course.\r\nThe EUs GDPR, which took effect in 2018, gave data watchdogs unprecedented fining powers and also made those authorities, the main supervisor for them.\r\nThe case is: C-252/21, Meta Platforms e.a.

        "full_text": "Key Insights\r\n<ul><li>The considerable ownership by retail investors in SoFi Technologies indicates that they collectively have a greater say in management and business strategy\r\n</li><li>41% of the business is held by the top 25 shareholders\r\n</li><li> Insiders have been selling lately \r\n</li></ul>To get a sense of who is truly in control of SoFi Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:SOFI), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 48% to be precise, is retail investors. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.\r\nFollowing a 3.9% increase in the stock price last week, retail investors profited the most, but institutions who own 36% stock also stood to gain from the increase.\r\nLet's delve deeper into each type of owner of SoFi Technologies, beginning with the chart below.\r\n View our latest analysis for SoFi Technologies \r\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About SoFi Technologies?\r\nInstitutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.\r\nWe can see that SoFi Technologies does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at SoFi Technologies' earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.\r\nearnings-and-revenue-growth\r\nSoFi Technologies is not owned by hedge funds. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 7.4% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 4.8% and 4.5% of the stock. Furthermore, CEO Anthony Noto is the owner of 0.7% of the company's shares.\r\nA deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.\r\nWhile studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.\r\nInsider Ownership Of SoFi Technologies\r\nThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.\r\nMost consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.\r\nIt seems insiders own a significant proportion of SoFi Technologies, Inc.. It is very interesting to see that insiders have a meaningful US$835m stake in this US$8.0b business. Most would say this shows a good degree of alignment with shareholders, especially in a company of this size. You can click here to see if those insiders have been buying or selling. \r\nGeneral Public Ownership\r\nThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 48% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.\r\nPublic Company Ownership\r\nPublic companies currently own 4.8% of SoFi Technologies stock. This may be a strategic interest and the two companies may have related business interests. It could be that they have de-merged. This holding is probably worth investigating further.\r\nNext Steps:\r\nWhile it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.

These projects will enable rural communities to acquire renewable energy systems and energy-efficient farm equipment.\r\nThe DOE of State and Community Energy Programs (SCEP) attempts to disburse USD 8.8 billion in refunds from the Inflation Reduction Act to Tribes and states for home energy efficiency and electrification projects.\r\nThe U.S. Department of Transportation has published a Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) for USD 1.5 billion in grant funding through the Rebuilding American Infrastructure with Sustainability and Equity (RAISE) discretionary grant program for 2023. The popular program helps communities nationwide carry out projects with significant local or regional impact. In 2022, RAISE funded 166 projects in all 50 states.\r\nCanada announced a USD 964 million program in 2022 to assist smart renewable energy and grid modernization projects that would reduce emissions by investing in clean energy technologies such as wind, solar, storage, hydro, geothermal, and tidal. Several wind farm &amp; solar projects are progressing in regions such as Quebec, Ontario &amp; Alberta, which is expected to trigger the demand for power equipment rental.\r\nGovernments Focus on Electrification in Rural and Indigenous Communities to Boost the Demand for Power Rental Equipment\r\nCanada's Smart Renewables and Electrification Pathways (SREPs) Program allocated USD 1.56 billion towards smart renewable energy and electrical grid modernization projects. These projects shall gradually reduce greenhouse gas emissions with increased renewable capacity, which will further support Canada's energy transition towards a net zero economy by 2050, also attaining 100% net zero electricity by 2035.\r\nFocusing on clean power, the Canadian federal government launched the 2030 Emission reduction plan in assurance to support local power solutions and community-driven projects, which are intended to enhance the resilience of energy commodities for forthcoming generations. This plan will increase the number of projects and contribute to the North America power rental market.\r\nUnder the Rural program, the U.S. government will invest nearly USD 2 billion in infrastructure development programs across rural areas until 2026. Such infrastructure investments will enhance highways, bridges, and tunnels and address highway safety issues. Also, such projects will boost access to agricultural, commercial, energy, or freight facilities that support the economy and offer flexible transportation services to rural regions, as announced in December 2022.\r\nApplications for funding worth USD 10 billion were submitted to the Department of Energy, significantly more than the funding amount of just USD 300 million for 2022.\r\nDemand for Leasing Power Equipment Backed by Restoring Power Occurred Due to Natural Calamities in Various Regions of North America\r\nA severe storm occurred in Quebecbetween December 23 and December 25, 2022, and the breezes were 110km/hr in major parts of the province. The effect caused around 7,500 outages and affected about 640,000 people. The storm left 380,000 homes without electricity, and it took around 63 hours to restore 85% of the electricity. Harsh climatic conditions and the need for electricity are raising the demand for rental power generation equipment in the North America power rental market.\r\nIn 2020, extreme weather events accounted for 1.33 billion outage hours 2020, up 70% since 2019. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, outages cost the U.S. economy USD 150 billion annually. Market surveys of eight economic sectors, including batch manufacturing, healthcare/hospitals, continuous manufacturing, digital economy, government/education, grocery/food stores, and retail, found that a four-hour power disruption costs individual businesses an average of USD 10,000 to USD 20,000.\r\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has granted its first certification to Caterpillar's fast reaction natural-gas generator sets for emergency and non-emergency situations. They can also be ordered with different emissions-reduction technologies that reduce NOx levels to as little as 0.5 g/bhp-hr without after-treatment. As customers concentrate on their environmental, social, and governance goals, natural-gas generator sets are becoming more and more appealing to standby power solutions.\r\nKEY QUESTIONS ANSWERED:\r\n<ul><li>How big is the North America power rental market?</li><li>What is the growth rate of the North America power rental market?</li><li>What are some significant trends in the North America power rental market?</li><li>Which fuel type is projected to dominate the North America power rental market?</li><li>Which are the key vendors in the North America power rental industry?</li></ul>Key Attributes:\r\n<table><tr><td>Report Attribute\r\n</td><td>Details\r\n</td></tr><tr><td>No. of Pages\r\n</td><td>174\r\n</td></tr><tr><td>Forecast Period\r\n</td><td>2022 - 2029\r\n</td></tr><tr><td>Estimated Market Value (USD) in 2022\r\n</td><td>$4498.9 Million\r\n</td></tr><tr><td>Forecasted Market Value (USD) by 2029\r\n</td><td>$6018.2 Million\r\n</td></tr><tr><td>Compound Annual Growth Rate\r\n</td><td>4.2\u00a0%\r\n</td></tr><tr><td>Regions Covered\r\n</td><td>North America\r\n</td></tr>\r\n</table>\r\nProminent Vendors\r\n<ul><li>United Rentals</li><li>Sunbelt Rentals</li><li>Herc Rentals</li><li>Aggreko</li><li>Caterpillar</li><li>Atlas Copco</li><li>Cummins Inc.</li><li>KOHLER</li></ul>Other Prominent Vendors\r\n<ul><li>Generac</li><li>APR Energy</li><li>H&amp;E Equipment Services</li><li>Sunstate Equipment</li><li>Home Depot Rental</li></ul>Segmentation By Fuel\r\n<ul><li>Natural Gas</li><li>Diesel</li><li>Others (Propane, Hydrogen, Renewable Sources)</li></ul>Segmentation By Power Rating\r\n<ul><li>&lt; 75KVA</li><li>-375KVA</li><li>5-1,000KVA</li><li>Above 1,000 KVA</li></ul>Segmentation By Equipment\r\n<ul><li>Generators</li><li>Load Banks</li><li>Transformers</li><li>Others</li></ul>Segmentation By End-User\r\n<ul><li>Construction</li><li>Retail</li><li>Oil &amp; Gas</li><li>Mining</li><li>Events</li><li>Utilities</li><li>IT &amp; Data Center</li><li>Manufacturing</li><li>Others</li></ul>Segmentation By Application\r\n<ul><li>Standby</li><li>Continuous</li><li>Peak Shaving</li></ul>For more information about this report visit https://www.researchandmarkets.com/r/n9zzid\r\nAbout ResearchAndMarkets.comResearchAndMarkets.com is the world's leading source for international market research reports and market data.

It has also put an end to all media and advertising spend and capital flows into and out of the country.\r\nAt the same time, Unilever said it continues to supply everyday food and hygiene products made in Russia to people in the country.\r\n\u201cWe understand why there are calls for Unilever to leave Russia. We also want to be clear that we are not trying to protect or manage our business in Russia. However, for companies like Unilever, which have a significant physical presence in the country, exiting is not straightforward,\u201d the statement said.\r\nUnilever argued that it does not have many options in Russia. The company said that closing down the business would mean the loss of around 3,000 jobs, and a chance for the Russian state to take control. \r\n\u201cIt is clear that were we to abandon our business and brands in the country, they would be appropriated \u2013 and then operated \u2013 by the Russian state. In addition, we do not think it is right to abandon our people in Russia,\u201d the company said.\r\nUnilever added that selling the business could lead to \u201cthe Russian state potentially gaining further benefit,\u201d while the third option \u201cis to allow the business to run with the strict constraints\u201d that Unilever put in place last March.\r\nThe company added that \u201cnone of these options is desirable. Nevertheless, we believe the third remains the best option, both to avoid the risk of our business ending up in the hands of the Russian state, either directly or indirectly, and to help protect our people.\u201d",

Remote working frequently leads to higher Employee Satisfaction (E-SAT), which leads to higher overall Customer Satisfaction (C-SAT). A remote workforce allows an organization to hire the best talent from all over the world, which improves both the local and global customer experiences. Organizations that want to keep their customer experience scope onshore/nearshore could benefit from a right-shored work-at-home model rather than an offshore-only model. These developments would further drive the growth of the customer experience management market during the forecast period.\r\nOrganizations have implemented new business models in order to broaden their customer reach and improve the end-user experience. Organizations are also working to improve their ability to adapt to changing customer expectations as well as market conditions. Several industries and industry verticals are expanding their customer reach by utilizing various e-commerce models such as e-retail, direct-to-customer (D2C), marketplace, and social commerce. For instance, Oracle Corporation, a software company, provides Oracle Commerce, a unified B2C, and B2B e-commerce platform. The solution uses interactive dashboards and data visualizations and takes real-time insights from every customer engagement.\r\nCustomer Experience Management Market Report Scope\u00a0\r\n<table><tr><td>Report Attribute\r\n</td><td>Details\r\n</td></tr><tr><td>Market size value in 2023\r\n</td><td>USD 12.04 billion\r\n</td></tr><tr><td>Revenue forecast in 2030\r\n</td><td>USD 32.87 billion\r\n</td></tr><tr><td>Growth rate\r\n</td><td>CAGR of 15.4% from 2023 to 2030\r\n</td></tr><tr><td>Base year for estimation\r\n</td><td>2022\r\n</td></tr><tr><td>Historical data\r\n</td><td>2018 - 2021\r\n</td></tr><tr><td>Forecast period\r\n</td><td>2023 - 2030\r\n</td></tr>\r\n</table>\r\nCustomer Experience Management Market Segmentation \u00a0\r\nGrand View Research has segmented the global customer experience management market report based on analytical tools, touch point type, deployment, end-use, and region.\r\nCustomer Experience Management Market - Analytical Tools Outlook (Revenue, USD Million; 2018 - 2030)\r\n<ul><li>EFM Software</li><li>Speech Analytics</li><li>Text Analytics</li><li>Web Analytics &amp; Content Management</li><li>Others</li></ul>Customer Experience Management Market - Touch Point Type Outlook (Revenue, USD Million; 2018 - 2030)\r\n<ul><li>Stores/Branches</li><li>Call Centers</li><li>Social Media Platform</li><li>Email</li><li>Mobile</li><li>Web Services</li><li>Others</li></ul>Customer Experience Management Market - Deployment Outlook (Revenue, USD Million; 2018 - 2030)\r\nCustomer Experience Management Market - End-use Outlook (Revenue, USD Million; 2018 - 2030)\r\n<ul><li>BFSI</li><li>Retail</li><li>Healthcare</li><li>IT &amp; Telecom</li><li>Manufacturing</li><li>Government, Energy &amp; Utilities</li><li>Construction, Real Estate &amp; Property Management</li><li>Service Business</li><li>Others</li></ul>Customer Experience Management Market - Regional Outlook (Revenue, USD Million; 2018 - 2030)\r\n<ul><li>North America</li><li>Europe</li><ul><li>U.K.</li><li>Germany</li><li>France</li><li>Italy</li><li>Denmark</li><li>Finland</li><li>Norway</li><li>Sweden</li></ul><li>Asia Pacific</li><ul><li>China</li><li>India</li><li>Japan</li><li>Australia</li><li>New Zealand</li></ul><li>Latin America</li><li>Middle East &amp; Africa</li></ul>List of Players in Customer Experience Management Market\r\n<ul><li>Adobe</li><li>Avaya Inc.</li><li>Clarabridge</li><li>Freshworks Inc.</li><li>Genesys</li><li>International Business Machines Corporation</li><li>Medallia Inc.</li><li>Open Text Corporation</li><li>Oracle</li><li>Qualtrics</li><li>SAP SE</li><li>SAS Institute Inc.</li><li>Service Management Group (SMG)</li><li>Tech Mahindra Limited</li><li>Verint</li><li>Zendesk</li><li>Miraway</li></ul>Check out more related studies published by Grand View Research:\r\n<ul><li>Customer Relationship Management Market - The global customer relationship management market size is expected to reach USD 163.16 billion by 2030 with a significant CAGR of 13.9% from 2023 to 2030, according to the new report by Grand View Research, Inc.

        "file_name": "2023-07-04_62392520.txt",
        "full_text": "Dublin, July 04, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The \"Pharmaceutical Contract Development and Manufacturing Organization (CDMO) Market - Growth, Trends, COVID-19 Impact, and Forecasts (2023 - 2028)\" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.\r\nThe pharmaceutical CDMO market is expected to register a CAGR of 7.29% to 2028\r\nThe contract development and manufacturing organization outsourcing market may expand due to the expanding pharmaceutical sector. The key trend affecting the market's growth is the growing usage of analytics by CDMOs.\r\nA growing number of pharmaceutical companies have recognized the potential profitability of working with a CMO for clinical and commercial-stage manufacturing. This is due to the increasing demand for generic drugs and biologics, the capital-intensive nature of the industry, and the complex manufacturing requirements.\r\nThe growth of the CRO industry is driven by several main factors, including the development of new therapeutic modalities focused on personalized medicine, the emergence of biopharma companies, consumer demand for more affordable medications and higher productivity levels, and technological advancements such as artificial intelligence and digitization.\r\nPharmaceutical outsourcing has evolved from basic processes, such as bottling, to more value-added techniques like medical device engineering and R&amp;D. The increasing number of patients undergoing medical procedures, along with improvements in illness detection and diagnosis in developing countries, has contributed to the growth of the market. There has been a gradual shift in the working principles of companies in this market.\r\nThis shift includes a move from cost-control to a re-emphasis on value-added services, leading to the redefining of CMOs as CDMOs (contract development and manufacturing organizations) and their integration into the value chain of companies. While the costs invested in R&amp;D continue to rise, the generation of valuable results from these processes is becoming increasingly rare.\r\nMany companies have realized that moving this part of their business overseas and taking advantage of emerging pharmaceutical markets can effectively reduce costs. The production of the COVID-19 vaccine and the expanding biologic pipeline have fueled unprecedented growth in the CMO market, particularly in the parenteral segment.\r\nThe COVID-19 outbreak had a positive impact on the market as pharmaceutical companies faced the sudden challenge of producing millions of vaccine doses for the global population. To accommodate the new vaccines, companies like Pfizer and AstraZeneca transferred non-COVID-19 biologics out of their proprietary manufacturing networks. CMOs signed contract manufacturing service agreements at an unprecedented rate in previous years due to compressed timelines and manufacturing scaling challenges associated with COVID-19 vaccines and medicines.\r\nPharmaceutical CDMO Market Trends\r\nIncreasing Investment in R&amp;D Expected to Drive the Market\r\nThe United States is one of the largest pharmaceutical markets, accounting for about half of the R&amp;D spending in the pharmaceutical and biotech markets.\r\nCMOs play a vital role in this market, investing in new facilities and technology to serve a wide range of outsourcing entities.

Customers feel like the product is worth more and are willing to pay a higher price. With the rise of social media, there has been an increased demand for personalized packaging that appeals to the unique preferences of individual consumers.

This also enables them to access products that may not be available in their local stores or that they may have yet to learn about previously. In addition, the growth of e-commerce sales in the cosmetics industry has also fueled the demand for cosmetics packaging products.

The U.S. is the biggest maker of beauty care products and their bundling. It trades high volumes of essential items in many regions of the planet. The makers in the locale are selecting green bundling arrangements and regular items. Likewise, shoppers in the European district are additionally selecting practical bundling arrangements. The purchasers in the locale are changing to post-customer reused (PCR) bundling; thus, the beauty care product makers are on the bleeding edge to take on PCR plastic bundling in their items at every possible opportunity.\r\nMarket Dynamics\r\nIncreasing Demand for Personalized Packaging to Flourish the Market\r\nPersonalized packaging helps brands stand out in a crowded market, making them more recognizable and memorable. Creating unique packaging helps leverage the emotional connection between the consumers and the brand. In addition, customized packaging is seen as more premium and exclusive, which can increase the product's perceived value. Customers feel like the product is worth more and are willing to pay a higher price. With the rise of social media, there has been an increased demand for personalized packaging that appeals to the unique preferences of individual consumers. This has led to the development of customization options for cosmetics packaging, such as custom colors, shapes, and sizes that cater to the unique needs of different consumers.\r\nGrowing E-commerce Sales to Propel Market Growth\r\nOne of the main reasons for the growing e-commerce sales in cosmetics packaging is the ease and convenience of online shopping. Consumers can shop for things from the convenience of their own homes and have them delivered right to their door. This also enables them to access products that may not be available in their local stores or that they may have yet to learn about previously. In addition, the growth of e-commerce sales in the cosmetics industry has also fueled the demand for cosmetics packaging products. As more consumers shop for cosmetics online, the need for reliable and durable packaging materials has increased.

With the introduction of online shopping, there has been an increase in demand for cosmetics packaging that is both appealing and functional for delivery. Bottles are an ideal solution for transporting both liquids and solids.\r\nThe cosmetics packaging industry in the Asia Pacific has witnessed significant growth in recent years. One of the key drivers for this growth is the rise in demand for beauty and personal care products in the region. The increasing consumer spending on cosmetics and personal care products across countries in the Asia Pacific has resulted in an increase in demand for innovative and attractive packaging solutions that help these products stand out on shelves.\r\nNorth America positions second on the lookout, exceptionally overwhelmed by the United States.

Creating unique packaging helps leverage the emotional connection between the consumers and the brand. In addition, customized packaging is seen as more premium and exclusive, which can increase the product's perceived value. Customers feel like the product is worth more and are willing to pay a higher price. With the rise of social media, there has been an increased demand for personalized packaging that appeals to the unique preferences of individual consumers. This has led to the development of customization options for cosmetics packaging, such as custom colors, shapes, and sizes that cater to the unique needs of different consumers.\r\nGrowing E-commerce Sales to Propel Market Growth\r\nOne of the main reasons for the growing e-commerce sales in cosmetics packaging is the ease and convenience of online shopping. Consumers can shop for things from the convenience of their own homes and have them delivered right to their door. This also enables them to access products that may not be available in their local stores or that they may have yet to learn about previously. In addition, the growth of e-commerce sales in the cosmetics industry has also fueled the demand for cosmetics packaging products. As more consumers shop for cosmetics online, the need for reliable and durable packaging materials has increased.

Segments Covered: Facility Type, IT Infrastructure, Electrical Infrastructure, Mechanical Infrastructure, Cooling Systems, Cooling Technique, General Construction, and Tier Standards. Market Participants: IT Infrastructure Providers, Support Infrastructure Providers, Data Center Contractors &amp; Subcontractors, Data Center Investors, and New Entrants. \r\nKEY HIGHLIGHTS\r\nThe US is one of the most connected countries in the world and is a favorable location for data center operators to build and develop data center facilities. The country offers one of the best and most robust inland connectivity and is witnessing several new submarine projects that will improve its connectivity with other countries worldwide. Virginia, Texas, California, and Georgia are among the top states attractive locations for hyperscale investments. Operators such as Microsoft, Amazon Web Services, Meta (Facebook), Switch, QTS Realty Trust, and others are building large data centers in these states. Further expansion of these facilities will also be in the pipeline in the coming years. Despite increasing PPA prices, the procurement of renewable energy by major colocation and hyperscale operators such as Google, Microsoft, Digital Realty, CyrusOne, Meta (Facebook), and Amazon Web Services is likely to remain high and favorable as a curb to reduce emissions, be carbon neutral, and achieve higher sustainability. Regions with technical parks, special economic zones (SEZs), free trade zones (FTZs), and investment support or tax incentives for developing data centers will witness growth. In 2022, there were several land acquisitions by global and local data center colocation service providers and hyperscale operators to develop new data center facilities in the US. Chip shortage is one of the major shortages faced by data center operators, which leads to a decline in the manufacturing of several infrastructures.

The new products acResin\u00aeZeroPCF A 260 UV, A 250 UV and A 204 UV are identical in quality and properties to their conventional counterparts. The carbon footprint of acResin\u00aeLowPCF UV 3532 has been reduced by more than 80%. The PCFs of BASF's BMB products are calculated according to the new \"Together for Sustainability\" (TfS) guideline and comply with ISO 14067:2018.2All of these products are manufactured at BASF's integrated production site in Ludwigshafen, Germany, and sold worldwide.\r\nThe outstanding sustainability profile of acResin\u00ae is made possible by the BMB approach. This was developed for complex production systems like those found at BASF. Instead of fossil feedstock (e.g., naphtha and natural gas), equivalent quantities of certified renewable feedstock are fed into the system at an early stage of acResin\u00ae production. This has been confirmed by the independent REDcert2 and ISCC PLUS certifications3. T\u00dcV Rheinland Energy GmbH, an independent certification body, has confirmed the PCF calculations for acResin\u00ae ZeroPCF and acResin\u00ae LowPCF. \"We have reviewed the PCF calculations for acResin\u00ae ZeroPCF and acResin\u00ae LowPCF and are pleased to confirm their plausibility,\" says Susanne Jorre, Sustainability Expert at T\u00dcV Rheinland Energy GmbH.\r\n\"We're especially satisfied with this accomplishment because it helps the adhesives industry cut carbon emissions while retaining the outstanding performance of acResin\u00ae,\" explains Prof. Dr. Thomas Schiele, Vice President Adhesives, Fiberbonding &amp; Paper Coating Chemicals EMEA at BASF. \"Furthermore, by adding acResin\u00ae ZeroPCF to our portfolio, we have expanded our sustainable product range for a more circular economy.\"\r\nHigh performance and sustainable acResin\u00aehas been designed for use in the manufacture of high-performance self-adhesive specialty labels and tapes for the automotive, construction, medical, cosmetics, food and beverage industries. These carbon-neutral solutions ideally combine high-performance properties and sustainability benefits. The use of renewable feedstocks has not changed the quality and performance of acResin\u00aeZeroPCF and acResin\u00aeLowPCF when compared with those of their conventional counterparts. In addition, the UV-curable 100% acrylic hotmelt contains only minimal amounts of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and is characterized by low odor and good skin compatibility. Moreover, the products in the acResin\u00aeportfolio have the following properties: high clarity for transparent films, outstanding resistance to aging and heat as well as resistance to water and chemicals. The products all comply with the strict requirements for adhesives with food contact.\r\nThe introduction of acResin\u00ae ZeroPCF and acResin\u00ae LowPCF represents a major step forward in the implementation of BASF's sustainability strategy and its drive to develop more net zero products to meet its climate protection goals. These products make it possible to reduce CO2 emissions in the relevant industries without compromising on quality.\r\nFind out more about acResin\u00ae at http://www.basf.com/acresin.\r\nFind out more about BASF's biomass balance approach at: https://www.basf.com/global/en/who-we-are/sustainability/we-drive-sustainable-solutions/circular-economy/mass-balance-approach/biomass-balance.html\r\nFind out more about the \"Together for Sustainability\" guideline at: https://www.basf.com/global/en/who-we-are/sustainability/whats-new/sustainability-news/2022/Chemical-industry-agrees-on-global-standard-for-calculating-product-carbon-footprint.html\r\n1 BASF's product carbon footprint (PCF) calculations comply with the requirements and guidance provided by ISO 14067:2018. A methodology review carried out by T\u00dcV Rheinland Energy GmbH has certified that the PCF methodology SCOTT that was developed and is used by BASF SE for calculating the PCFs of BASF products complies with ISO 14067:2018 and reflects the state of the art. In addition, it is proven that the PCF calculations for the biomass balance products, which is used to decrease the PCF cradle-to-gate to zero or lower, is following the requirements of the respective ISO standards 14040 &amp; 14044 (H. K. Jeswani, 2019. A methodology for integrating the biomass balance approach into life cycle assessment with an application in the chemicals sector. Science of the Total Environment 687, 380-391).\r\n2 A product carbon footprint (PCF) of zero kg CO2e/kg was calculated for acResin\u00ae ZeroPCF by cradle-to-gate assessment. The assessment took into account all product-related greenhouse gas emissions and the biogenic uptake of the renewable raw materials used in the value chain and attributed to the products via a certified mass balance approach. The calculations did not include packaging and other downstream value chain emissions such as emissions generated by transporting the products from factory gate to customer, emissions arising from further processing and end-of-life emissions (e.g., from waste treatment).\r\n3 REDcert2 and ISCC PLUS are standards developed for the use of sustainable biomass as raw materials in the chemical industry. The certification issued for BASF's biomass balance approach on the basis of these standards confirms that the biomass used is sustainable and has been fed into the production Verbund in the requisite amounts. It also certifies that the sustainable biomass is being used for the corresponding sales products. The certifications are awarded following on-site audits carried out by independent auditors.",

This means we are now on track to commence the next phase of the project which will see the installation of the wind farm in late 2023.\r\n\"Our close working relationship with Barclays has given us the support required to meet the UK and Scottish government renewable energy targets.\"\r\nBarclays remains as one of only seven banks which have supported two project-financed offshore wind farms involved in the Contract for Difference* allocation rounds in the UK looking to innovate with sophisticated offtake agreement strategies.**\r\nIt executed the hedges at the point the project was awarded the Contract for Difference in July 2022 and then syndicated them to the lending banks at financial close. Barclays has particular expertise around the inflation hedge which is highly illiquid, however it is able to place on the back of its first in class distribution platform.\r\nJamie Grant, Managing Director of Barclays Corporate Banking in Scotland, added: \"Barclays expertise and sophisticated approach to the financing of such a major development in Scotland's green economy reinforces our ability to support key clients in the renewables sector which look to innovate with revenue offtake strategies. With the commodity cost escalations that have been experienced recently, it is likely that more renewable developers will also consider innovation with their offtake strategies and we are well placed to support projects like Moray West.\"\r\nThe deal team was led by Neil Fleming, Infrastructure and Project Finance Director at Barclays Corporate Banking.\r\nEnds.\r\nNotes to editors:\r\n*More information about the government's CfD scheme is available here https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/contracts-for-difference/contract-for-difference\r\n** Offtake arrangements are agreements between the producer and a buyer, to purchase or sell portions of the producer's energy.",

        "full_text": "Perth, Australia (ABN Newswire) - QX Resources Limited (ASX:QXR) is pleased to announce that Bayrock Resources Limited (Bayrock) has successfully completed its rights issue to raise A$1.8 million through the issue of new shares at $0.03 per share (before costs) (Rights Issue). Existing Bayrock shareholders subscribed for ~$600,000 under the Rights Issue. QXR was the underwriter to the Rights Issue, and following the conversion of QXR-provided secured loans to Bayrock, and fees payable to QXR, QX Resources Limited now holds a ~39% interest in the issued capital of Bayrock. Further details of the Underwriting Agreement are set out in the Annexure to the Company's announcement dated 8 May 2023. Bayrock has a portfolio of highly prospective battery minerals assets in Sweden, primarily in nickel, cobalt and copper. Bayrock is now fully funded to carry out its planned exploration activities at the Lainejaur Ni-Cu-Co project and the Northern Nickel Line projects, Sweden.\r\nHIGHLIGHTS\r\n- Bayrock Resources Limited (Bayrock), an unlisted public Australian company with a portfolio of highly prospective battery minerals exploration and development assets in Sweden, has successfully completed its A$1.8 million rights issue, with ~$600,000 raised from existing Bayrock shareholders.\r\n- QX Resources acted as underwriter and following the conversion of QXR-provided secured loans and fees, QXR now holds a significant ~39% of Bayrock's issued capital.\r\n- Bayrock has a portfolio of highly prospective battery minerals assets in Sweden, primarily in nickel, cobalt and copper. Following completion of the Rights Issue, Bayrock completed the acquisition of all of the Bayrock projects, and is now funded to carry out further exploration at Lainejaur and the Northern Nickel Line projects in Sweden.\r\n- A diamond drill rig has been mobilised to the Vuostok project, a near surface nickel-copper project within the Northern Nickel Line, with a series of approximately 15 shallow drillholes (~450m) planned.\r\n- Assay results for the diamond hole at Lainejaur are due in the coming weeks. \r\nBayrock Exploration Update\r\nBayrock has engaged a Scandinavian drilling company to mobilise a diamond drill to the Vuostok project, a near surface nickel-copper project within the Northern Nickel Line projects. Approximately 15 shallow drill holes (~450m) are planned at the Storbodsund Deposit within the Vuostok project, where high-grade nickel and copper was previously intersected 70 years ago in a flat-lying deposit of near-surface sulphides (within 20m of surface), covered by a thin veneer of glacial moraine.\r\nIn the recent Bayrock Prospectus (5 May 2023), available on the Bayrock website (see website link below), the Vuostok Ni-Cu sulphide Project mineralization is described as a shallow flat-lying body of massive Ni-Cu sulphides (average grade of 2.3% Ni and 0.6% Cu (including up 3.7% Ni), between 0.3 and 3.9 meters thick, covered by glacial sediments. The sulphides were intersected by six Boliden Minerals AB drill holes completed during copper exploration in 1947 and the deposit remains open to the north, west and south. The mineralization is located close to the basal section of a gabbroic intrusive along the contact with underlying granite. \r\nThe Vuostok project is located about 60km northwest of the Lainejaur Project. The aim of the drilling is to identify and characterise sufficient mineralisation within potential trucking distance of the Lainejaur project to advance the potential for future stand-alone nickel-copper operations or additional ore feed for a potential Lainejaur operation. The two deposits are connected by all-weather roads and both are close to considerable support infrastructure.\r\nAs announced 14 June 2023, drilling at the Lainejaur Ni-Cu-Co project intersected visual sulphide mineralisation. Bayrock is expecting final assay results and an analysis of the results from the diamond drill hole at Lainejaur in the coming weeks.\r\nComment\r\nQX Resources Executive Chairman Maurice Feilich commented: \"Bayrock has received excellent support from its existing shareholder base, and together with QXR's investment, the Company is sufficiently capitalised to deliver further value through ongoing drilling in Sweden. We are encouraged with progress to date and look forward to first assays from the Lainejaur Ni-Cu-Co project and updates from the program at Vuostok where the drill rig is turning.\r\n\"QXR also expects to shortly provide shareholders with plans for the next phase of exploration activities planned at its Pilbara lithium assets which remain an important focus for the Company.\"\r\nhttps://www.bayrockresources.com/site/investor-centre/investors-centre\r\nAbout QX Resources Ltd:\r\nQX Resources Limited (ASX:QXR) is focused on exploration and development of battery minerals, with hard rock lithium assets in a prime location of Western Australia (WA), and gold assets in Queensland. The aim is to connect end users (battery, cathode and car makers) with QXR, an experienced explorer/developer of battery minerals, with an expanding mineral exploration project portfolio and solid financial support.\r\nLithium portfolio: QXR's lithium strategy is centred around WA's prolific Pilbara province, where it has acquired a controlling interest in four projects through targeted M&amp;A - all of which sit in strategic proximity to some of Australia's largest lithium deposits and mines. Across the Pilbara, QXR's regional lithium tenement package (both granted or under application) now spans more than 350 km2.\r\nGold portfolio: QXR is also developing two Central Queensland gold projects - Lucky Break and Belyando - through an earn-in agreement with Zamia Resources Pty Ltd. Both gold projects are strategically located within the Drummond Basin, a region that has a &gt;6.5moz gold endowment.\r\nSource:QX Resources Ltd\r\nContact:\r\nSteve Promnitz\r\nManaging Director\r\nT: +61-423-333-296\r\nE: steve@qxresources.com.au\r\nMaurice Feilich\r\nExecutive Chairman\r\nT: +61-411-545-262\r\nSam Jacobs\r\nSix Degrees Investor Relations\r\nT: +61-423-755-909",

A greater proportion of patients who received JNJ-2113 achieved\u00a0PASI 75 (primary endpoint) as well as PASI 90 and PASI 100 (75, 90 and 100 percent improvement in skin lesions as measured by the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index, respectively)a compared to placebo, at week 16.1\u00a0Trial results for JNJ-2113 demonstrated a profile1\u00a0that supports its advancement into Phase 3 clinical development for moderate-to-severe plaque PsO in adult patients.\r\nJNJ-2113 is a novel oral IL-23R antagonist peptide that binds with high affinity to the IL-23R and has properties that allow it to be absorbed with oral dosing.2,3\u00a0The IL-23/IL-23R signaling pathway plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases, including PsO.4,5 JNJ-2113 selectively and potently blocks IL-23 signaling and downstream inflammatory cytokine production.2,6\r\nPASI 75 Results Primary EndpointThe proportions of adult patients receiving JNJ-2113 (n=212)1\u00a0who\u00a0achieved PASI 75 demonstrated the following dose responses at week 16 compared to 9.3 percent of patients receiving placebo (n=43) (nominal p 0.002 for all comparisons):1\r\n<ul><li>37.2 percent at 25 mg daily (n=43)</li><li>51.2 percent at 25 mg twice daily (n=41)</li><li>58.1 percent at 50 mg daily (n=43)</li><li>65.1 percent at 100 mg daily (n=43)</li><li>78.6 percent at 100 mg twice daily (n=42)</li></ul>PASI 90 Results Secondary EndpointThe proportions of adult patients receiving JNJ-2113 who achieved PASI 90 demonstrated the following dose responses at week 16\u00a0compared to 2.3 percent of patients receiving placebo (n=43) (nominal p 0.002 for all comparisons):1\u00a0\r\n<ul><li>25.6 percent at 25 mg daily (n=43)</li><li>26.8 percent at 25 mg twice daily (n=41)</li><li>51.2 percent at 50 mg daily (n=43)</li><li>46.5 percent at 100 mg daily (n=43)</li><li>59.5 percent at 100 mg twice daily (n=42)</li></ul>PASI 100 Results Secondary EndpointThe proportions of adult patients receiving JNJ-2113 who achieved PASI 100 also demonstrated the following dose responses at week 16\u00a0compared to 0 percent of patients receiving placebo (n=43) (nominal p 0.05 for all comparisons):1\u00a0\r\n<ul><li>11.6 percent at 25 mg daily (n=43)</li><li>9.8 percent at 25 mg twice daily (n=41)</li><li>25.6 percent at 50 mg daily (n=43)</li><li>23.3 percent at 100 mg daily (n=43)</li><li>40.5 percent at 100 mg twice daily (n=42)</li></ul>Treatment was generally well tolerated, and the proportions of patients with adverse events were comparable between patient groups.1\u00a0The proportion of participants experiencing one or more adverse events (AEs) was 52.4 percent (n=111) in the combined JNJ-2113 group and 51.2 percent (n=22) in the placebo group.1\u00a0Although there was variability across the treatment groups, there was no evidence of a dose-dependent increase in the occurrence of specific AEs across the JNJ-2113 treatment groups.1\u00a0The most frequent system organ class involved in AEs in all groups was infections and infestations, which were 30.2 percent (n=64) vs. 27.9 percent (n=12) in the combined JNJ-2113 group vs. placebo group, respectively; of these, the most common were comparable between groups: COVID-19 (10.8 percent [n=23] vs. 11.6 percent [n=5]), nasopharyngitis (7.1 percent [n=15] vs. 4.7 percent [n=2]) and upper respiratory tract infection (2.4 percent [n=5] vs. 2.3 percent [n=1]).1\r\n\"Patients are looking for more flexible and convenient treatment options to manage the signs and symptoms of psoriasis, and these positive early results for JNJ-2113 are encouraging,\" said Robert Bissonnette, M.D., FRCPC, Chief Executive Officer and Medical Director, Innovaderm, Montreal, Canada, and Lead Investigator of the FRONTIER clinical trial.b \"The majority of people living with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis are eligible for but are still not receiving advanced therapies.c,7 For many patients, a pill is preferable to an injection.d,8\"\r\n\"The development of a novel oral\u00a0therapy that specifically targets IL-23R could potentially change the treatment paradigm for patients living with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis,\" said Lloyd Miller, M.D., Ph.D., Vice President, Immunodermatology Disease Area Stronghold Leader, Janssen Research &amp; Development, LLC. \"Until now, advanced psoriasis treatments have been largely limited to injectable biologics. An oral therapy that can uniquely inhibit the IL-23 pathway by directly targeting the IL-23 receptor could help address the needs and preferences of patients, and may offer greater freedom, with the aim of driving greater adoption of advanced treatment.\"\r\nThese findings from the FRONTIER 1 clinical trial suggest the potential of JNJ-2113 across the spectrum of additional IL-23-mediated diseases, and as a next step, Janssen plans to advance JNJ-2113 into Phase 3 development for moderate-to-severe plaque PsO and initiate a Phase 2b clinical trial for adults living with ulcerative colitis.\r\nEditor's Notes: \r\n<ol><li>\u00a0</li><ol><li>\u00a0</li><ol><li>The\u00a0PASI score grades the amount of surface area on each body region that is covered by PsO plaques and the severity of plaques for their redness, thickness and scaliness.9</li><li>Dr. Robert\u00a0Bissonnette is a paid consultant for Janssen.

        "file_name": "2023-07-04_62392974.txt",
        "full_text": "After eight years, Mr Ayade left office with most of the grandiose projects he proposed uncompleted but however went ahead to commission them.\r\nBen Ayade, a professor of Environmental Microbiology and former lecturer at Delta State University, was young, articulate and vibrant when he decided to join active politics about a decade and a half ago.\r\nElected into the Senate to represent Cross River North on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in 2011, Mr Ayade was later elected the governor of Cross River State in 2015. He took over from Liyel Imoke, also a former senator.\r\nTo prove his wide acceptability among the people, Mr Ayade defeated his closest rival, Odey Ochicha of the then opposition All Progressives Congress (APC), with a margin of almost 300,000 votes.\r\nCampaign promises\r\nLike a typical Nigerian politician, Mr Ayade boasted of his capacity to turn around the fortunes of Cross River, a state once considered to be the tourism capital of Nigeria.\r\nThough it is difficult to come by a codified document chronicling Mr Ayade's manifesto throughout his tenure, the former governor at various fora pledged to build infrastructure and industries, and provide job opportunities for the state's growing population of youths.\r\nMeanwhile, without clear-cut breakdowns and analyses, Mr Ayade became notorious for deploying jaw-breaking phrases to qualify his annual budget proposals - a development that informed analysts' description of the former governor as an \"entertainer\".For instance, Mr Ayade's first budget proposal in office in 2016 was tagged \"Budget of Deep Vision\" while that of 2017 was named \"Budget of Infinite Transposition,\" and the one for 2018 was titled: \"Budget of Kinetic Crystallisation.\"\r\nIn 2019, Mr Ayade gave the title as \"Budget of Qabalistic Densification,\" and the 2020 as \"Budget of Olimpotic Meritemesis\"; 2021 was \"Budget of Blush and Bliss\"; 2022 as \"Budget of Conjugated Agglutination,\" and that of 2023 was titled \"Quantum Infinitum\".\r\nApart from laying the fat document before the parliamentarians in the state, Mr Ayade was in the habit of only making his budget presentations in a few words, making it difficult for the residents to have a full idea of what the documents contained.\r\nBut in his Democracy Day broadcast in 2016, Mr Ayade promised to make Cross River Africa's industrial hub.\r\nHe said: \"We are fully reloaded to make Cross River State the construction hub for Africa... with sincere commitment, with the love and fear of God, with all your support, Cross River State indeed shall move from 3rd world to 1st world under my watch.\"\r\nBut eight years after, residents have decried what they described as the \"deception in governance\" allegedly represented by Mr Ayade.\r\nWhile many of the tourist attractions in the state have reportedly been abandoned, many of his much touted industries were said to have remained uncompleted or executed poorly.\r\nOffiong Edet, a broadcast journalist resident in the state, expressed sadness over what he termed the inglorious abandonment of the tourism sector in the state. He said Mr Ayade's predecessors had invested massively in various tourism sites, and had marketed them to the world but that the administration of Mr Ayade \"killed the tourism industry in the state.\"\r\n\"Calabar had nice tourist sites but these are no longer functional, thanks to Mr Ayade's administration. Political instability has always been a major problem in any administration because every individual comes with different ideologies,\" said Mr Edet.\r\nWhat data says - increased IGR, high debt profile\r\nUsing data on key socio-economic indicators, PREMIUM TIMES examined the performance of Mr Ayade since he assumed office in 2015.\r\nIncreased IGR\r\nIn 2015, before Mr Ayade took office, the Internally Generated Revenue (IGR) of Cross River State was N13.56 billion, according to the National Bureau of Statics (NBS).\r\nThe IGR increased from N14.77 billion in 2016 to N18.10 billion in 2017 and decreased to N17,55 billion in 2018.\r\nBy 2019, the IGR of the state grew to N22,59 billion, a 28.74 increase from the previous year.\r\nIn the State of States Report 2022, a fiscal performance analysis of each of the 36 states of the federation by Budgit- a Nigerian non-governmental civic organisation, Cross River State generated the 19th largest IGR in 2021. The report stated that the state's revenue grew by 41.58 per cent from N16.18 billion in 2020 to N22.91 billion in 2021.\r\nBudgit, however, said the state still heavily depended on the Federation Account Allocation Committee (FAAC) revenues, noting that the previous investments in projects such as a garment factory which was projected to employ 3,000 people, and the 24,000-per-day chicken processing plant, ought to have translated into more IGR for the state.\r\nOverall, the available data shows a 69 per cent increase in IGR in the state from 2015 to 2021 as of the last available data.\r\nHuge debt profile\r\nAccording to data from the Debt Management Office (DMO), Cross River in 2021 and 2022 had total debts of N159.81 billion and N197.21 billion respectively.\r\nCross River's debt grew by 75.21 per cent between 2016 and 2021, making it the fifth most indebted state in the country as of December 2021, while its total debt stock grew by 16.52 per cent from N236.30 billion in 2020 to N275.34 billion in 2021\r\nOn foreign debt, the state experienced a growth rate of 45.32 per cent from $192.48 million to $279.71 million, ranking it the third most indebted state on foreign borrowings which by extension makes it one of the most exposed states to exchange rate volatility.\r\nAccording to Budgit, Cross River and four other states: Lagos, Kaduna, Rivers, and Ogun -- are responsible for 37.09 per cent of total subnational debt.\r\nBut Mr Ayade has repeatedly denied the debt figures. In a recent interview on Arise TV, the former governor said he had been servicing the debt which he noted was already high when he assumed office in 2015.\r\nHe said: \"All the entire debts mentioned are debts that I met. I met between N383 to N403 billion debt as governor. I have been servicing this debt by approximately N2.2 billion every month which has dropped down to about N1.6 billion today.\r\n\"So, I didn't borrow money. I have never borrowed from any foreign country.\"\r\nListed as one of the worst states to do business\r\nIn March, the Presidential Enabling Business Environment Council (PEBEC), a Federal Government Agency responsible for facilitating the ease of doing business in Nigeria, listed Cross River as one of the worst states in Nigeria to do business.\r\nPEBEC ranked Cross River 33rd out of 37, after scoring 4.99, which the agency said was below the national average of 5.69. The latest position is six places worse than its 2021 ranking of 28.\r\nAccording to Budgit in its 2022 report which ranked the state 27th on ease of doing business, Cross River is the 14th largest economy with an estimated GDP of N4.07 trillion, attracting $ 25.85 million as capital importation between 2019 and 2021.\r\n\"Cross River is blessed with numerous natural resources that, if properly harnessed, can make the state prosperous... More deliberate measures need be taken to improve the state's ease of doing business,\" the report noted\r\nUnemployment\r\nAs of the fourth quarter (Q4) of 2020, NBS data shows that the unemployment rate in Cross River stands at 53.65 per cent.\r\nThe report noted that the state has a total unemployed number of 998,203 and an underemployment rate of 17.81 per cent.\r\nBut in his reaction, Mr Ayade in an interview on Arise Tv said the data is false and an old report, but he could not provide his 'accurate' version.\r\nHe said, \"Statistically speaking, I met Cross Rivers State at that high figure of unemployment and that has changed dramatically.\"\r\nWhen asked about the chicken factory project he claimed would reduce the state's unemployment rate, he said the project was delayed due to a lack of materials to produce the feeds for the chicken.\r\nHe said: \"On the Calachika Chicken, the first of its kind in the whole of Africa I must say, unfortunately, we need a lot of soya bean and maize to be able to produce the feeds. The feed meal is there, the poultry is there and the factory is there.\r\n\"Unfortunately, we need massive amounts of soya beans to be able to produce the feed to feed the chicken to be able to get them to the slaughterhouse. And so, we try to encourage young people to go into farming. That has been particularly difficult, occasioned by the issues of insecurities, lack of the initial capital\".\r\nLast-minutes commissioning of projects\r\nAfter eight years, Mr Ayade left office with most of the grandiose projects he proposed uncompleted but however went ahead to commission them.\r\nIn an interview with BBC Pidgin in 2022, Mr Ayade promised that before the end of his tenure, he would complete the Obudu International Cargo and Passenger Airport, revamp the Obudu Cattle ranch, complete the Teachers Continuous Training Institute (TCTI), spaghetti flyover, among others.\r\nIn less than one week to the end of his tenure, the governor embarked on a last-minute commissioning of the TCTI, for which he had promised over N200,000 salary for teachers after certification, while the Obudu International Airport is still under construction, and the ranch not revamped.\r\nAs posted on the official Facebook page of the state's Public Communications Department, Mr Ayade on 25 May inaugurated four projects in Calabar, the state's capital.

They are just there with the equipment locked up in their cartons,\" Mr Edet said.\r\nTUC leader speaks\r\nThe Chairman of the Cross River chapter of the Trade Union Congress (TUC), Monday Ogbodum, recently disclosed that no civil servant in the state was promoted by Mr Ayade in the last seven years.\r\nThe TUC chairman, who scored the outgoing administration low on workers' welfare, said that aside from the regular payment of salaries and pensions, \"workers had the worst welfare under the administration.\"\r\nRead the original article on Premium Times.",

The avocado seedlings are aimed at giving the community a reason to double their efforts towards forest conservation by planting fruit trees within their farms for commercial gain.\"\r\nKenya Re's commitment to contribute towards forest rehabilitation builds on last year's event where they planted 50,000 tree seedlings at Uplands Forest Station in Kiambu county with support from the local community forest association.\r\nThis year, Kenya Re is slated to plant 10,000 tree seedlings at Lenana School, Nairobi in furtherance of its environmental conservation efforts.\r\nSign up for free AllAfrica Newsletters\r\nGet the latest in African news delivered straight to your inbox\r\nSuccess!\r\nAlmost finished...\r\nWe need to confirm your email address.\r\nTo complete the process, please follow the instructions in the email we just sent you.\r\nError!\r\nThere was a problem processing your submission.

Your donation directly benefits the community-based women and youth led organisations engaged in tree nursery business who will provide the 500,000 indigenous tree seedlings needed for Kaptagat forest rehabilitation. Local communities are key to the success of forest conservation.\"\r\nThe Kaptagat Forest Annual Tree Planting event will this year take place around Kessup, Sabor, Kaptagat, Pennon and Kipkabus forest blocks.\r\nThe Corporation's support to environmental conservation comes in the backdrop of the enhancement of its brand awareness via its well-known flagship Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) programme - Niko Fiti. The programme has now been revamped to include 3 pillars -Education, environment and support for persons with disability.\r\nRead the original article on Capital FM.",

        "full_text": "(Alliance News) - Drax Group PLC's biomass power plant could lose subsidies if it is found not to be complying with sustainability requirements, a minister has said.\r\nThe House of Lords heard concerns on Monday over the environmental credentials of the power station in North Yorkshire, one of the UK's largest, and which burns biomass such as wood pellets and receives green subsidies.\r\nOne peer called for independent scientists to be sent to Canada to verify the sustainability of wood used to make biomass pellets, and another accused a minister of having his \"head in the sand\" over the issue.\r\nThe energy regulator Ofgem said in May that it was investigating whether Drax Power Limited is in breach of \"annual profiling reporting requirements relating to the Renewables Obligations scheme and other related matters\".\r\nLast week, campaigners from Greenpeace, WWF, the RSPB, Wildlife Trusts, Wildlife and Countryside Link and Mighty Earth and others called on the Government to end all subsidies for burning wood from forests and energy crops in power stations and to not award energy companies any new support or contracts to do so.\r\nDrax describes itself as providing renewable power using \"sustainable biomass\".\r\nThe industry claims that the wood is sustainably sourced from forestry waste, but critics have raised doubts over the veracity of these sustainability claims.\r\nGovernment minister Martin Callanan told the upper chamber: \"This is a matter for Ofgem.\r\n\"The regulator is the administrator for monitoring compliance with the sustainability criteria within the renewables obligation scheme.\"\r\nLabour peer Maggie Jones said: \"It's estimated that we will have given Drax some GBP11 billion in subsidies over the different renewable energy schemes.\r\n\"So is the minister concerned that Drax's claim to be using sustainably-sourced wood from Canadian forests currently lacks any detailed full-cycle carbon accounting and audit trail that we would have the right to expect for that level of subsidy?\"\r\nShe added: \"Does the minister accept that to get to the truth, independent advisors and scientists should go to Canada to check that in fact 70% of the wood biomass being imported is actually sustainable off-cuts... and not from virgin forests?\"\r\nCallanan responded: \"The renewables obligation legislation was actually originally introduced by the last Labour government.\r\n\"Ofgem are investigating these matters. She's jumping to a lot of conclusions there, and if it is proved that they are not in compliance, then of course some of the value of the certificates they have received will be withdrawn.\"\r\nLiberal Democrat peer Cathy Bakewell of Hardington Mandeville said: \"The emissions which occur as a result of Drax burning mature trees are not counted as CO2 emissions. Only those transporting trees from forests to furnace count.\r\n\"When is the government going to wake up to this ridiculous accounting fraud and stop giving Drax green subsidies?\"\r\nCallanan said: \"Again, the noble lady is jumping to conclusions before the investigation has proceeded.\r\n\"Based on the evidence that has been reviewed to date, Ofgem has not established any non-compliance with the scheme, but the investigation is continuing.\r\n\"I would just caution noble lords to wait for the outcome of the investigation by what is an independent regulator.\"\r\nIndependent crossbencher Rosie Boycott referenced information from Canadian environmentalists who she had reported \"the ancient forest being destroyed for those wood pellets\".\r\nShe said: \"Why on earth do you still persist in saying that we are jumping to conclusions, when you're burying your head in the sand?\"\r\nCallanan said: \"As somebody famous once remarked, recollection of facts may vary. And forgive me if I don't necessarily take as absolute facts the statements by some of the Canadian environmentalists.\r\n\"Officials have looked into it. Ofgem are investigating whether the biomass is sustainable or not. Let's wait for the outcome of that investigation.\"\r\nsource: PA\r\nCopyright 2023 Alliance News Ltd. All Rights Reserved.",

The market is estimated to rise at a CAGR of 4.75%. APAC held the largest share of the global market in 2022, and the market in the region is estimated to witness an incremental growth of\u00a056%.\u00a0The use of recycled plastics in the industries such as automotive, textile, and construction drives the growth of the regional market. The automotive industry uses recycled plastics due to the properties of recycled plastics such as high tensile strength and stiffness, creep resistance, and wear resistance the automotive industry widely uses these plastics. Rising automotive production will drive the demand for recycled plastics in the region because recycled plastics help to reduce a vehicle's overall mass and enhance its fuel efficiency. Furthermore,\u00a0These plastics are also used in the production of roofing tiles, structural lumber, concrete, indoor insulation, PVC windows, bricks, and fences. Hence, the expansion of the\u00a0construction industry and the rising automotive industry in this region\u00a0will drive the growth of the recycled plastics market during the forecast period.\u00a0For more insights on the historic period (2017 to 2021) and forecast market size (2023\u00a0to 2027)\u00a0-\u00a0Request a sample report\r\nWhat's New?\r\n<ul><li>Special coverage on the Russia-Ukraine war; global inflation; recovery analysis from COVID-19; supply chain disruptions, global trade tensions; and risk of recession\u00a0</li><li>Global competitiveness and key competitor positions\u00a0</li><li>Market presence across multiple geographical footprints - Strong/Active/Niche/Trivial\u00a0 -\u00a0buy the report!</li></ul>Global Recycled Plastics Market - Segmentation AssessmentSegment Overview\r\nTechnavio has segmented the market based on\u00a0type (PET, HDPE, PP, LDPE, and Others), industry application (packaging, construction, automotive, electrical and electronic components, and others),\u00a0and geography (APAC, Europe, North America, Middle East and Africa, and South America).\u00a0\r\n<ul><li>The PET\u00a0segment will be significant during the forecast period.

Moreover, recycled plastics are widely used in the construction industry.\u00a0 Owing to the high infrastructure\u00a0development in developing economies the consumption of recycled plastics in the construction sector is high. Thus, the construction industry accounted for a significant market share in the recycled plastics market. Hence, the rising demand for infrastructure projects in emerging countries\u00a0is expected to drive the growth of the global recycled plastics market during the forecast period.\r\nMajor Trend\r\nThe increasing demand for recycled plastics in the automotive industry is a key trend shaping the growth of the recycled plastics market.\u00a0Plastics and composites are\u00a0lightweight materials that are commonly used in the application process in the\u00a0automotive industry. Some of these applications include\u00a0structural, powertrain, exterior and interior, and electronic and electrical components. Automakers are focusing on producing lighter, more fuel-efficient, and environmentally friendly vehicles to meet stringent environmental regulations. Using recycled plastic reduces vehicle weight, fuel consumption, and greenhouse gas emissions. Hence, rising vehicle production across the world will grow the demand for recycled plastics during the forecast period.\r\nsignificant challenge\r\nThe increasing demand for biodegradable plastics is the key challenge impeding\u00a0the growth of the recycled plastics market.\u00a0The preference for biodegradable materials is increasing among manufacturers and market players, with\u00a0the rising demand from consumers for eco-friendly packaging. Moreover, government regulations regarding the use of plastic products are motivating manufacturers to push for biodegradable plastics. The growth of the biodegradable plastics market is driven by the emergence of renewable resources, such as biomass and bio-based raw materials. Hence, the rising demand for biodegradable plastics\u00a0will hinder the growth of the recycled plastics market during the forecast period.\r\nInsights on Market Drivers, trends, &amp; Challenges, historic period(2017 to 2021), and forecast period(2023 to 2027)-\u00a0Request a\u00a0sample report!\r\nWhat are the key data covered in this Recycled Plastics Market report?\r\n<ul><li>CAGR of the market during the forecast period</li><li>Detailed information on factors that will drive the growth of the recycled plastics market between 2023 and 2027</li><li>Precise estimation of the recycled plastics market size and its contribution to the market in focus on the parent market</li><li>Accurate predictions about upcoming trends and changes in consumer behavior</li><li>Growth of the recycled plastics market\u00a0across APAC, Europe, North America, Middle East and Africa, and South America</li><li>A thorough analysis of the market's competitive landscape and detailed information about vendors</li><li>Comprehensive analysis of factors that will challenge the growth of recycled plastics market vendors</li></ul>Gain instant access to 17,000+ market research reports.\u00a0\r\nTechnavio's SUBSCRIPTION platform\r\nRelated Reports:\r\nThe\u00a0plastics market for passenger cars industry\u00a0size is estimated to grow at a\u00a0CAGR of 10%\u00a0between 2022 and 2027.

        "full_text": "See You in My 19th Life: Episodes 5-6\r\nWith our reincarnated heroine dropping hints faster than Taylor Swift drops new singles, its only a matter of time before people begin questioning her identity. Some are open-minded and their suspicions are surprisingly close to reality, but others worry our heroine has nefarious intentions. Either way, knowing the truth may have unexpected consequences \u2014 and Im not talking about only past lives anymore.\r\n\u00a0EPISODES 5-6\r\nOne of the things I love most about See You in My 19th Life is that the secondary characters \u2014 and their respective relationships to the leads \u2014 have a lot of substance. For me, one test of a romance\u2019s quality is my ability to stay engaged and away from the fast-forward button whenever the OTP is absent from my television screen. This week I found myself equally \u2014 if not more so \u2014 invested in the sisterly bond between Ji-eum and Cho-won. There was still plenty of romance to go around, but it was definitely a more sisters-before-misters kind of week as we delve deeper into Cho-wons grief and how it has bonded her to Ji-eum and affected her relationship with Seo-ha in the past and at present.\r\nGiven that she was much younger than Seo-ha when Ju-won passed away, Cho-wons anguish was reactionary and misdirected. We see via flashbacks that young Cho-won blamed Seo-ha for her sisters death because \u2014 child logic \u2014 he was in the car with Ju-won and failed to protect her. Although Cho-won has matured and no longer holds Seo-ha responsible, she only just now realizes how scarred Seo-ha is from the accident and how her own emotional distress and unfiltered words as a child likely contributed to the distance hes put between them. Well, guess what? Its time to build bridges and close that gap!\r\nAfter a nightmare about Ju-won puts Seo-ha in a bad headspace, he retreats to his pool where its peaceful, quiet \u2014 and much to Cho-wons worry \u2014 away from his cell phone. A panicked Cho-won assumes the worst when she cant get in touch with him, and then finds him floating in the water. Her tears of relief as she clings to a surprised and bewildered \u2014 and very much alive \u2014 Seo-ha ease some of the tension between them. \r\nOf course, Seo-has more welcoming demeanor is largely due to Ji-eum, and while a part of him feels guilty that hes developing feelings for her \u2014 especially when she reminds him of Ju-won \u2014 theres no denying the positive effect shes had on his personality. Both Cho-won and Do-yoon have noticed the changes, which is why Cho-won invites Ji-eum on their spontaneous group trip to the beach. And as we all know, in dramaland a beach trip is either fluffy filler or an opportunity for introspection and revelations. Luckily, we get both this time around.\r\nWe start with the fluff. A walk along the beach turns into a serious conversation as Seo-ha hints to Ji-eum that she\u2019s been on his mind. Ji-eum sees it as an opportunity and asks him to date her. He declines, but his hesitation is noticeably long. Unperturbed, and with two confessions remaining, Ji-eum coaxes Seo-ha into dancing with her next to a lighthouse, which K-dramas have conditioned me into believing are peak romance. Seo-has stiff awkwardness gives way to a relaxed and carefree smile as they dance together next to the ocean.\r\nThe romantic moment ends when it starts to rain, and our couples-who-arent-couples-yet retreat to the nearby beach house belonging to Cho-wons family. Its here that Ji-eums uncanny familiarity with the house fans the flames of Cho-wons suspicions. But as Cho-won edges closer to realizing the truth, Do-yoon dashes her hopes with an ice cold bucket of dont-trust-the-strange-woman-softly-stalking-Seo-ha. Do-yoons still leary of Ji-eum, and I cant say that I blame him. After all, she admitted to having an ulterior motive, and most people would logically assume shes a gold-digger or corporate spy, not a reincarnated first love. \r\nSo with Do-yoons words of caution weighing her down, Cho-won drowns in a complex cocktail of hope and doubt, which she then decides to mix with alcohol. In this state, Cho-won confronts Ji-eum, but even as she accuses Ji-eum of using her to get closer to Seo-ha, Cho-won admits shes crushed and confused by her own instincts. Shed held onto an irrational hope that Ji-eum was, by some miracle, her sister. As Cho-won cries, Ji-eum is struck by the familiar urge to comfort her little sister. Even though she knows its a massive risk, she tells Cho-won the truth: she was Ju-won in her past life. \r\nCho-won doesnt immediately trust Ji-eum and must first confirm some details with her mother. Once shes a believer, though, their dynamic instantly changes, and Cho-won cutely reverts to being the younger sister, eager to reveal the truth to their mother and Seo-ha. Ji-eum dashes her hopes of a family reunion, though, and explains the complexities of telling others about her past lives. For starters, experience has taught Ji-eum that people dont always react positively to the news. And as far as Seo-ha goes, well, he needs a therapist to work through his grief on his own, and Ji-eum worries that shes already pushing her limits by being around him as Ji-eum. (Hes just too irresistible, though!)\r\nHowever, thats not the worst of it! Thanks to some vague conversations between HAN-NA (Lee Hanna), mystery character #1, and KANG MIN-KI (Lee Chae-min), mystery character #2 who is now a part-timer at Ae-gyeongs restaurant we learn that theres a potentially dangerous (deadly?) consequence facing anyone that learns about Ji-eums past lives. Were left to deduce that Ae-gyeongs mysterious illness \u2014 that shes hiding from Ji-eum \u2014 is directly related to her awareness that Ji-eum was her uncle. So does this mean Cho-won is now in danger?! Eep!\r\nBut wait! Theres more! In addition to the two mystery characters we have floating around in the background forewarning of bad things to come, we have loan sharks \u2014 but not just any loan sharks. It turns out the boss man BANG HO-SHIK was the hired thug behind the car accident that killed Ju-won \u2014 but she wasnt the intended target. No, someone wanted young Seo-ha dead, and that person is still unidentified.\r\nTo be honest, Im getting a little bit overwhelmed by the frequent flashbacks to the car accident and child death. Its starting to remind me of Why Her?, which replayed the death from Episode 1 over and over, as if wed somehow forget that shocking moment. I will acknowledge, though, that See You in My 19th Life is at least making the flashbacks relevant to the present story being told. Last week, we learned that the core source of Seo-has trauma was feeling Ju-wons body grow cold on top of his, and this week we found out that the driver of Seo-has vehicle was Do-yoons father \u2014 a fact that Seo-ha just learned, as well.\r\nAs I briefly mentioned last week, Do-yoon is a bit aloof and doesnt reciprocate Seo-has friendship with the same freeness as his younger brother HA DO-JIN (Lee Shi-woo). While some of this can be probably explained by the nature of his fathers death \u2014 and the fact hes been keeping it a secret \u2014 Do-yoon is also keenly aware of his social status and how outsiders perceive his friendship with Seo-ha. And \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 this is largely why he rejected Cho-won, too.\r\nWhen Seo-ha learns that Do-yoons father was his driver who died in the car accident with Ju-won, the two confront their feelings the old-fashioned way: by throwing fists until theyre both too exhausted to avoid talking about the sh*t that needs to be said. Although their verbal and nonverbal communication did not outwardly damage their friendship, Seo-ha still walks away with a cloud over his head. This is why, in a moment of vulnerability and growth, he asks Ji-eum for a hug when he sees her waiting outside his door.\r\nSo much progress was made with the story and our characters this week that Im hopeful the latter half of the drama will cover a lot of ground and wrap up everything satisfactorily \u2014 even if, realistically, Seo-ha needs a 100-episode weekend drama to heal from all his trauma. Even without therapy, though, our boy is making slow and steady progress. Its sweet how each interaction with Ji-eum reminds him bit by bit that its okay to smile and laugh and \u2014 most importantly \u2014 let go of Ju-won. Although, since Ji-eum is Ju-won, the water is a little murky on how much his healing is actually a form of displacement, but Im just going to go with the happier alternative since Im still blissfully enjoying this drama.\r\nThere was also a little bit of progress with our secondary couple this week, and it amuses me that Cho-won is just as aggressive \u2014 albeit slightly less confident \u2014 as her sister when it comes to romance. Her little slip-up in the stairwell when she accidentally told Do-yoon that she liked him? Yeah, adorable. And speaking of the stairwell \u2014 Do-yoon knows! Well, he overheard Cho-won call Ji-eum her sister, but we know hes too practical to believe anything they said. I cant wait to find out what happens! (Well, I know what happens in the webtoon, but I cant wait to see it play out in the drama!)\r\n\u00a0RELATED POSTS",

Roczen was joined on the overall podium by Joey Savatgy and Vince Friese.\r\nKen Roczen\r\nShane McElrath went one-two-one in the SX2 class, Max Anstie second and Enzo Lopes third overall on the SX2 rostrum.\r\nThe night started perfectly for Roczen on his PMG Suzuki; fastest in warm-up and fastest in qualifying before winning his heat race by a comfortable margin to make it through to Superpole.\r\nAfter Dean Wilson, Matt Moss, Savatgy, and Friese had set their lap times, Justin Hill, aboard the BUD Racing Kawasaki set Villa Park alight by going nearly a second quicker than anyone else. Roczen followed, but he was unable to go quicker, and Hill took the extra championship point.\r\nA frenetic start to the opening main event saw Friese take an early lead on his MotoConcepts Honda from a flying Thomas Ramette. Hill and Roczen were third and fourth, and eventually made it past Ramette, before Roczen passed Hill and set off after Friese. However, the fans were denied a grandstand finish when Friese went down out of the lead. He still held on to second, with Hill third.\r\nRoczen again gave himself work to do off the start in the second main event, while Friese hit the front and pulled away. The reigning champion reeled him in, but was unable to find a way past and took the chequered flag first and second. However, the pair were penalised for jumping through a medical flag, and demoted to third and fourth. As a result, Hill inherited the win, ahead of Rick Ware Racings Savatgy.\r\nA battle at the front of the final main of the night saw Roczen, Friese, and Savatgy go bar-to-bar. Unfortunately for Friese he went down, as Roczen pulled away. Savatgy was second, ahead of home hero Wilson. Friese took the chequered flag in 10th.\r\nKen Roczen \u2013 P1\r\nThe track wasnt super technical but it was hard tonight. And my starts werent where they needed to be so I gave myself some work and had to make some passes. With the races being so short you had to make a plan on the fly and pass when you could and it got a bit close. But I was strong in the whoops and tried to stay low over the jumps. I had to push hard tonight, and weve got some areas where we want to get better.\u201d\r\nKen Roczen\r\nVince Friese \u2013 P2\r\nIm happy with where I was tonight. The injury Ive had is like a year injury and Im seven months in. The goal was always to come back better and continue to improve. I had an issue with the footpegs but, I believe Ive got the best bike on the grid. Ill continue to heal and get closer to Ken [Roczen]. Ive got to make it hard for him but beat him tonight, Ive shown hes beatable and Ill only get better.\r\nVince Friese\r\nJoey Savatgy \u2013 P3\r\nIm second tonight but honestly I wasnt the second best guy today. But Im on the podium, thats the goal, I want to be here every round. Weve got some things to work on and improve going forward but, I was second overall last year, and I want to make sure Im in that top three every round.\r\nJoey Savatgy\r\nSX1 GP Overall/Standings\r\n<table><tr><td>Pos.</td><td>Rider</td><td>Nat.</td><td>Man.</td><td>S.P.</td><td>R1</td><td>R2</td><td>R3</td><td>Total</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>ROCZEN Ken</td><td>GER</td><td>Suzuki</td><td>0</td><td>25</td><td>18</td><td>26</td><td>69</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>SAVATGY Joey</td><td>USA</td><td>Kawasaki</td><td>0</td><td>18</td><td>22</td><td>22</td><td>62</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>FRIESE Vince</td><td>USA</td><td>Honda</td><td>0</td><td>22</td><td>20</td><td>11</td><td>53</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>HILL Justin</td><td>USA</td><td>Kawasaki</td><td>1</td><td>20</td><td>25</td><td>6</td><td>52</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>WILSON Dean</td><td>GBR</td><td>Honda</td><td>0</td><td>15</td><td>16</td><td>20</td><td>51</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>CHISHOLM Kyle</td><td>USA</td><td>Suzuki</td><td></td><td>11</td><td>14</td><td>18</td><td>43</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>BRAYTON Justin</td><td>USA</td><td>Honda</td><td></td><td>16</td><td>13</td><td>12</td><td>41</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>NICHOLS Colt</td><td>USA</td><td>Kawasaki</td><td></td><td>14</td><td>12</td><td>13</td><td>39</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>ARANDA Gregory</td><td>FRA</td><td>Yamaha</td><td></td><td>5</td><td>15</td><td>16</td><td>36</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>MORANZ Kevin</td><td>USA</td><td>Honda</td><td></td><td>8</td><td>11</td><td>14</td><td>33</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>HILL Josh</td><td>USA</td><td>Yamaha</td><td></td><td>9</td><td>8</td><td>15</td><td>32</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>CLASON Cade</td><td>USA</td><td>KTM</td><td></td><td>2</td><td>10</td><td>10</td><td>22</td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td>RODRIGUEZ Anthony</td><td>VEN</td><td>KTM</td><td></td><td>7</td><td>7</td><td>8</td><td>22</td></tr><tr><td>14</td><td>SOUBEYRAS Cedric</td><td>FRA</td><td>Kawasaki</td><td></td><td>3</td><td>9</td><td>9</td><td>21</td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td>SEELY Cole</td><td>USA</td><td>Honda</td><td></td><td>13</td><td>6</td><td>1</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>16</td><td>TIXIER Jordi</td><td>FRA</td><td>Honda</td><td></td><td>6</td><td>5</td><td>7</td><td>18</td></tr><tr><td>17</td><td>RAMETTE Thomas</td><td>FRA</td><td>Yamaha</td><td></td><td>12</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>17</td></tr><tr><td>18</td><td>MOSS Matt</td><td>AUS</td><td>Yamaha</td><td>0</td><td>10</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>19</td><td>BRUNELL Jack</td><td>GBR</td><td>Husqvarna</td><td></td><td>0</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td>LEFRANCOIS Charles</td><td>FRA</td><td>Suzuki</td><td></td><td>0</td><td>2</td><td>5</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>21</td><td>CARTWRIGHT Josh</td><td>USA</td><td>Yamaha</td><td></td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>3</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>22</td><td>HARLIN Grant</td><td>USA</td><td>Yamaha</td><td></td><td>4</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>4</td></tr>\r\n</table>\r\nSX2\r\nIt was decided on a best of three in the SX2 mains, defending champion and 2022 vice champion Anstie resuming their rivalry from last season, trading main event wins.\r\nShane McElrath\r\nSadly for the Brit, Anstie was unable to deliver the overall for the home crowd, taking a brace of seconds on his Firepower Polyflor Honda to McElraths double victory aboard his Rick Ware Racing Yamaha.\r\nBrazilian Lopes showed hes going to be a force in this years championship, finishing third overall for Club MX FXR despite dislocating his shoulder in warm-up.\r\nMixing it at the sharp end of the mains, he was twice third before a crash in the final race cost him another rostrum finish. He managed to salvage fourth \u2013 finishing behind Mitchell Oldenburg \u2013 to take third overall in the British GP.\r\nShane McElrath- P1\r\nIts good to start with a win, McElrath said. Rick [Ware \u2013 team owner] said he wants to win a championship and he wants me to do that for him. I said this is what I need and hes made it happen. The Yamaha feels like my bike. Ive ridden lots of bikes but the Yamaha suits me, it feels good, and its good of Rick to trust us as riders to deliver. Im happy with tonight and its a good start to the season.\r\nShane McElrath\r\nMax Anstie \u2013 P2\r\nIt was tough tonight. Ive raced at home before and I know the vibe, but as well as the racing weve been pulled into different directions and lots of obligations, but its one of those, it comes with the territory and its a positive because its good for the sport; itll be the same for Kenny [Roczen] in Germany and its good for the fans to be able to support their guy. Hopefully we put on a show. It was close out there with Shane [McElrath], obviously I wanted to win and well go again in Singapore.\r\nMax Anstie\r\nEnzo Lopes \u2013 P3\r\nTo be here on the podium is incredible. I made the decision to do World Supercross after the US series. I turned down offers to race in America this summer to be here because I like racing with my team and I want to be the Ayrton Senna of supercross to Brazil. It also gives me time to spend at home with my family, otherwise Id spend the whole year in the US.

We seemed to be caught up in everyone elses incidents, which made for a very frustrating night. We will regroup and hit the ground running for round two in Singapore.\r\nThe early pace in the SX2 class was set by championship contender Clout, who topped the timesheets in the second SX2 qualifying session, while teammate Tanti posted the sixth-fastest time in qualifying group one.\r\nA consistent 7-8-9 scorecard across the event wasnt reflective of Australian national MX1 champion Tantis night, who was involved in opening corner carnage in each final by virtue of a difficult heat race and a poor gate position for the night show. Still, the number nine battled hard all evening, and was seventh overall.\r\nAaron Tanti \u2013 SX2 P7\r\nIm excited to be back racing the WSX Championship this year! My day started decent, but in my heat race I unfortunately got tangled up in the first turn and came from last to sixth place, which gave me a pretty average gate pick for the main. Starting wide meant I was involved in some sort of first turn carnage in every single main, though in saying that, Im happy with where we are in seventh to start the season, and well go home and work harder for the next one.\r\nAaron Tanti\r\nClout continued his form by notching a strong fifth place in the opening SX2 GP final, before misfortune struck in the second final where he was hit entering the first turn and went down. A seventh place in the final moto was a rebound to form, with the Australian finishing 11th overall on the night.\r\nLuke Clout \u2013 SX2 \u2013 P11\r\nRound one of World Supercross is in the books, which, overall, it was a decent day for me. Qualified third overall which was really good to show that my speed is pretty close to where I want to be, and that was confidence-building. Night show, got a great jump in the first final and ran up front early, I just got a bit tight as weve been off supercross for a while, so ended up in fifth. Then second race, good start, but thats where the chaos began when I got t-boned and that was pretty much all she wrote\u2026 Last race, I finished seventh, which was probably the best I rode, so I think well come out strong with a bit more prep at the next one. Big thanks to the CDR team, its a massive workload, so a big shoutout to them.\r\nLuke Clout\r\nThe story was similar in the WSX Class, with American racer Hill opening his day in Birmingham by posting the sixth fastest time in the first qualifying group. On a track that was hugely start-dependent, Hill struggled off the line from an outside gate pick, which therefore meant that he was engaged in mid-pack battles throughout the night, and would secure a 12-13-6 scorecard for 11th overall.\r\nJosh Hill \u2013 P11\r\nJust not really my night here in Birmingham. I struggled for flow throughout the day on the tight track and then with an average heat race, that gave me an average gate pick. Starts were so important here tonight, so if you didnt get a good one, most of your race was just battling in the mid-pack. Overall, Im stoked to be back racing in the WSX Championship with the CDR Yamaha Monster Energy Team again, and am looking ahead to round two now.\r\nJosh Hill\r\nA difficult encounter was on the cards for teammate Harlan on debut with CDR Yamaha Monster Energy, who qualified in seventh, before a tough start in the heat race resulted in a bad gate pick. The number 78 would hit the ground in all three main events, with a punctured radiator in main event three spelling an end to his Birmingham weekend.\r\nGrant Harlan \u2013 P22\r\nMy weekend started off good here, got comfortable with the bike in practice and qualifying. A bad start in the heat race held me from a good gate pick in the mains, and I ended up on the ground in all three main events. Punctured radiator in the third race put me out which was disappointing, but well re group in three months time for round two.\r\nMoto News Weekly proudly brought to you by Dunlop\r\n2023 French WSX round postponed\r\nThe FIM and SX Global, the official and exclusive promoter of the FIM World Supercross Championship (WSX) regret to announce that due to unforeseen scheduling and logistical challenges, the 2023 FIM World Supercross World championship round originally scheduled to take place in Lyon-D\u00e9cines, Groupama Stadium France on 22 July, has been postponed until further notice.\r\nAdditionally FIM and SX Global confirm that a new round in Abu Dhabi has been added to the 2023 calendar.Yas Island, Abu Dhabi will host the penultimate round of the FIM World Supercross Championship (WSX) in 2023.

In Moto 1, he stormed out to the holeshot and early lead over Orange Brigade KTMs Julien Beaumer and quickly built a multi-second advantage over the field.\r\nCasey Cochran \u2013 Image by Align Media\r\nBehind him Beaumer and Monster Energy Kawasaki Team Greens Drew Adams soon settled into second and third, respectively. However, Beaumer came up short on RedBuds famed LaRoccos Leap and damaged the spokes on his wheel, which would hinder his progress as the race continued. The top three in the running order remained unchanged leading up to the midway point of the moto.\r\nCochran continued to build on his lead while Beaumer maintained his hold on second, despite the damage. Behind them, Adams was forced to deal with pressure from Orange Brigade KTMs Ryder McNabb.\r\nThe Canadian started fifth but methodically worked his way into podium contention and made the pass on Adams for third right at the halfway mark. As Beaumers pace continued to be hampered from his damaged wheel he lost ground to McNabb and was eventually passed for second. Not long after he pulled out of the moto. That moved Adams back into third.\r\nOut front Cochran led every lap and took the checkered flag 16.6 seconds ahead of McNabb, followed by Adams in third. Monster Energy Kawasaki Team Greens Enzo Temmerman was fourth, while Orange Brigade KTMs Preston Boespflug rounded out the top five.\r\nMoto 2\r\nAs the field roared out the gate for the final moto of the day Cochran once again positioned his Husqvarna at the head of the pack with the holeshot while New Zealander Cole Davies slotted into second aboard his Yamaha ahead of Boespflug. Adams started in fourth, with Beaumer in fifth. McNabb started all the way back in 10th.\r\nRyder McNabb \u2013 Image by Align Media\r\nMuch like the first moto, the clear track proved advantageous for Cochran as he once again opened a multi-second lead over his rivals. Davies and Boespflug engaged in a spirited battle for second through the opening laps, from which the KTM rider eventually got the upper hand and made the pass. Their battle also allowed Beaumer to stay in the hunt from fourth and he was able to drop Davies out of the top three with a pass for third just before the halfway point.\r\nBeaumer continued his push forward and pressured his Orange Brigade teammate for several laps before making the pass on Boespflug for second. A three-rider battle amongst KTM teammates emerged in the waning laps as McNabb clawed his way into the top five and then into a fight for the podium. The Canadian made his way around Boespflug for third and closed in on Beaumer in his hunt for second.\r\nPreston Boespflug \u2013 Image by Align Media\r\nCochran once again enjoyed a drama-free moto and led every lap to put the finishing touches on a dominant afternoon. He took the win 7.9 seconds ahead of Beaumer, who rebounded from his Moto 1 misfortune and fended off late pressure to secure second, while McNabb settled for third, passing seven riders along the way.\r\nWith six minutes to go Lawrence was within striking distance of Roczen and went on the attack as soon as the opportunity presented itself. An outside line on an uphill off-camber gave Lawrence the momentum he needed to surge past Roczen and put another moto win within reach. Roczen kept him honest for a while, but Lawrence closed out the moto strong to keep his undefeated record intact by 2.4 seconds over Roczen, with Ferrandis in third.\r\nRedBud Combine overall podium finishers (L-R): Ryder McNabb, Casey Cochran, and Preston Boespflug \u2013 Image by Align Media\r\nRedBud Moto Combine Overall Results (Moto Finishes // Points)\r\n<table><tr><td>Pos</td><td>Rider</td><td>Man.</td><td>Results</td><td>Points</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Casey Cochran</td><td>Husqvarna</td><td>1-1\u00a0</td><td>50</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Ryder McNabb</td><td>KTM</td><td>2-3\u00a0</td><td>42</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Preston Boespflug</td><td>KTM\u00a0</td><td>5-4\u00a0</td><td>34</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Enzo Temmerman</td><td>Kawasaki\u00a0</td><td>4-6\u00a0</td><td>33</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Drew Adams</td><td>Kawasaki\u00a0</td><td>3-8\u00a0</td><td>33</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>Mark Fineis</td><td>GASGAS\u00a0</td><td>9-5\u00a0</td><td>28</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>Leum Oehlhof</td><td>Yamaha\u00a0</td><td>7-7\u00a0</td><td>28</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>Parker Ross</td><td>Honda\u00a0</td><td>8-9\u00a0</td><td>25</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>Trevin Nelson</td><td>Yamaha\u00a0</td><td>6-12</td><td>24</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>Julien Beaumer</td><td>KTM\u00a0</td><td>21-2\u00a0</td><td>22</td></tr>\r\n</table>\r\nMoto News Weekly proudly brought to you by Dunlop\r\n2023 AMA Pro Motocross Round Five \u2013 RedBud\r\nThe AMA Pro Motocross championship returned to the track for round five at RedBud MX, which celebrated its 50th anniversary, where Team Honda HRCs Jett Lawrence continued his streak with another perfect outing in which he led every lap to go 1-1 in the motos and capture his fifth straight victory.\r\nJett Lawrence\r\nThat second [moto], it took me a little bit to find my flowand it was the worst time for that because Dylan [Ferrandis] was right there! I didnt even know he was there at first; I saw my pit board with the gap and was like, Oh, weve got to step it up. Once I found my flow, I could go back to just trying to time things, and stuff like that. Its been an awesome season so far. Its Chases first race back since round 1, so hes going to get better and betterand the same with Dylan; hes made progress from the first race to now. Well just try to make sure we keep those starts good, because it makes it a lot easier on myself.\r\nJett leading the 450s\r\nIn the 250 Class, an unpredictable afternoon saw heartbreak befall the championship leader and opened the door for a breakthrough performance for Monster Energy Yamaha Star Racing rookie Haiden Deegan as the second-generation racer emerged with the first win.\r\nHunter Lawrence\r\nIt was a bit of a hero-to-zero day here at RedBud.
