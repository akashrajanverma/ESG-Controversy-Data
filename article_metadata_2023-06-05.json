        "file_name": "2023-06-04_62349826.txt",
        "full_text": "Over the past two weeks, no other company has dominated the headlines quite as much as Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA). Shares in the semiconductor giant, known for its graphics processing units (GPUs), have shot up 30% following the company\u2019s quarterly results. \r\nThe prolific rise of AI-powered tools and tasks is prompting data centres to overhaul their hardware to better suit this new wave. Being a primary provider of accelerated computing hardware, Nvidia is surfing this AI tsunami. \r\nHowever, at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 207, could investors be pricing in too much? Here\u2019s a brief analysis of whether I think Nvidia shares are worth the accompanying trillion-dollar price tag.\r\nSetting the scene\r\nThe current landscape of artificial intelligence has been described as \u2018the next internet\u2019 and having its \u2018iPhone moment\u2019. Indeed, the excitement is palpable, as the technology promises to pave the way to a more productive and creative future. \r\nIt\u2019s hard to ignore the numbers being thrown around. Grand View Research estimated the global AI market to be $207 billion last year, forecasting it to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 37.3% to 2030. \r\nLikewise, Goldman Sachs analysts believe generative AI could boost global GDP by $7 trillion and provide much-needed productivity growth. \r\nNvidia co-founder and CEO Jensen Huang has an eye-watering figure of his own. He expects $1 trillion worth of installed infrastructure to transition to accelerated computing over the next decade as generative AI becomes the \u201cprimary workload\u201d of data centres.\r\nWelcome to the AI ecosystem\r\nClearly, the market opportunity in AI is large, based on the above, but how would Nvidia shares benefit more than other semiconductor companies? It comes down to raw power. \r\nBoth the training and running of AI are incredibly compute-intensive. The rush to develop even more sophisticated AI necessitates the processing of more data in the form of large language models (LLMs) at a faster pace. \r\nThe team at Nvidia realises this. Their solution \u2014 providing unified componentry to increase throughput and power.\r\nUnlike its competitors, Nvidia is broadening its computational land grab by supplying the networking hardware, the central processing units (CPUs), the GPUs, and the software. \r\nPreviously, many of the world\u2019s most powerful supercomputers used a mishmash of parts from Nvidia and others such as Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) and Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ: AMD). \r\nSource: Nvidia Keynote COMPUTEX 2023 Presentation\r\nBy offering the full spread of hardware for accelerated computing, Nvidia can optimise the solution where others cannot, such as the use of bidirectional memory referencing between the CPU and GPU. \r\nWhat this enables is 256 Nvidia Grace Hopper Superchips being seamlessly connected in a single data hall, pictured above. \r\nFurther, I believe the desire for maximum speed and efficiency among customers will drive an even stronger monopoly in data centre hardware, and Nvidia is the frontrunner. \r\nCertainly, it becomes an uphill battle for AMD and Intel to sell CPUs if Nvidia offers an all-in-one solution.\r\nHow it becomes a moat\r\nThis leads me to what I believe is the company\u2019s moat. In my opinion, Nvidia is becoming the enterprise version of Apple. That is, build an install base through exceptional hardware; the hardware creates a high switching cost; then offer value-add software at high margins. \r\nNvidia\u2019s computing platform CUDA is its iOS while Nvidia\u2019s AI and Omniverse are its answer to Apple\u2019s lucrative services business.\r\nSource: Punch Card Investor, Substack.\r\nToday, there are millions of developers are using CUDA, a programming model for GPUs. In turn, many of the most advanced computing applications are exclusive to Nvidia. The flywheel will likely attract more developers and more advanced applications, driving greater adoption of Nvidia hardware.\r\nHow do you overcome this flywheel if you are AMD, Intel, or even Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) itself?\r\nI believe Nvidia\u2019s software/services could dramatically increase margins over time, thanks to this moat. \r\nIt all sounds impressive, doesn\u2019t it? It\u2019s probably why the company trades at more than 200 times earnings. The more bearish side of the argument is that nearly all of the upside is now priced in. \r\nThe more conservative fibre of my being tends to agree to an extent. \r\nIn my own long-term forecasts, I have estimated Nvidia\u2019s data centre revenue increases by nearly eightfold to US$115 billion in FY29. Additionally, potentially significant growth in gaming and auto places my total FY29 revenue estimate at US$139.6 billion, as shown below.\r\nPlease note these are my own personal estimates and should\u00a0not\u00a0form the basis of an investment decision\r\nAssuming the company can derive more of its earnings from higher margin sources, such as software, the earnings growth could be just as colossal. \r\nAs Nvidia\u2019s more profitable data centre segment grows, I believe net margins could reach 35% by FY29. This would equate to a net profit after tax (NPAT) of US$48.9 billion \u2014 increasing more than 11 times from the company\u2019s FY23 profits, depicted in the chart below.\r\nPlease note these are my own personal estimates and should\u00a0not\u00a0form the basis of an investment decision\r\nIf Nvidia shares then traded on a 35 P/E, we could be looking at a US$1.6 trillion company. In other words, an annualised return of 10.5% per annum over the next six years. \r\nConsidering the average return of the S&amp;P 500 over the past 150 years is 9%, that\u2019s a lot of execution risk for a slightly above-market average return. \r\nWhat if AI demand peters out to a reduced level? What happens if a prolonged recession hits and cloud service providers need to cut back their capital expenditure? How would it all shake out if competitors posed a credible threat?\r\nThere isn\u2019t much margin of safety.\r\nMy verdict on Nvidia shares\r\nIn summary, I think Nvidia could become the operating system of AI. The company could very well be building a moat, the likes of which have been seen before. In a decade or two, Nvidia has the potential to be worth trillions \u2014 yes, multiple \u2014 in my view.\r\nAt the same time, the current price makes it hard to see it as an asymmetric opportunity to the upside. It feels more evenly balanced at this point in time. \r\nFor now, I would be a holder of Nvidia shares. I certainly wouldn\u2019t be a seller, but I\u2019d like to see a lower price before buying.",

        "full_text": "Some observations:\r\n<ol><li>ML-relevant hardware supply is bottlenecked at several points.</li><li>One company, NVIDIA, is currently responsible for most purchasable hardware.[1]</li><li>NVIDIA already implements driver licensing to force data center customers to buy into the more expensive product line.[2]</li><li>NVIDIA would likely not oppose even onerous regulation on the use of its ML hardware if it gives them more of a competitive moat.</li></ol>Where can you stick a regulatory lever to prevent improper use of GPUs at scale?\r\nHere's one option![3]\r\nAlign greed with oversight\r\n<ol><li>Buff up driver licensing with some form of hardware authentication so that only appropriately signed drivers can run. (NVIDIA may do this already; it would make sense!)</li><li>Modify ML-focused products to brick themselves if they do not receive a periodic green light signal from a regulatory source with proper authentication.</li><li>Require chain of custody for ML-focused products. If an auditable chain of custody cannot be produced for a particular piece of hardware, stop sending a green light.</li><li>Use both targeted and randomized audits to confirm that hardware is being used for the stated purpose. Audits are not primarily automatic: regulators should have on-demand access to the physical hardware and verifiable detailed information on how the system is being used.</li><li>If audits are blocked or refused by a product owner, stop sending a green light.</li><li>While not a primary form of security, the hardware/driver could self-report on some kinds of usage patterns. It does not seem realistic to collect invasive data[4], but the combination of chain of custody and high-level samples of hardware utilization over time could help corroborate client claims or flag installations for audits.</li><li>I imagine NVIDIA would be happy to offer Certified ML-MOAT-2023-B Compliant hardware and drivers. Given the opportunity, they may even push regulators to implement progressively more difficult forms of verification to make it more expensive for smaller hardware providers to break into the market.[5]</li></ol>Between the cost of the hardware involved and the chain of custody information, it is unlikely that many small businesses would suffer excessive burdens as a result of the regulation. A company with 16 H100's is far less of a risk than a company with 140,000 H100's; you can probably skip the audit unless you have some reason to suspect the ostensibly small installations are attempting to exploit a loophole.\r\nClouds\r\nGPU cloud service providers (CSPs) obscure chain of custody and complicate audits. Getting sufficient regulatory oversight here will likely have the most consumer-visible impacts.\r\nOne option would be to require any compute requests above a certain threshold (either in terms of simultaneous compute or integrated compute over time) to meet KYC-style requirements.\r\nRegulators could lean on the CSP to extract information from large-scale customers, and those large-scale customers could be directly required to report or submit to audits as if they owned the hardware.\r\nGiven the profit margins for GPU CSPs, I suspect most major AI labs to prefer building out their own infrastructure or making special deals (like OpenAI and Microsoft). The main value of having requirements on CSPs would be to plug an obvious loophole that bad actors might otherwise try to abuse because it's still cheaper than their other options for getting access to tons of compute.\r\nIt is unlikely that any small research group would ever actually encounter the regulatory system. That helps keep regulatory overheads low and focuses the effort on the more dangerous massive deployments.\r\nThreat model exclusions\r\nThis doesn't do anything against an extremely capable hostile actor in the limit. The hardware and software are in the hands of the enemy, and no amount of obfuscation can protect you forever.\r\nIn reality, though:\r\n<ol><li>With a decent hardware-supported implementation, it can be pretty annoying to grab the requisite information.</li><li>Robust chain of custody makes getting hundreds of thousands of GPUs into the hands of those who would misuse them more difficult.</li><li>The main contenders in the current race dynamic operate in countries where large companies mostly obey laws. The main value of the extra security features in the hardware/software are to make it impossible to accidentally violate regulatory intent, and to make the intent legible.</li></ol>This also doesn't do anything to stop fully decentralized execution across consumer-grade hardware, but efficiently scaling large training runs over the internet with current approaches seems far more challenging than in the case of, say, Folding@Home.\r\nRegulatory targets\r\nI don't think it's reasonable to expect the regulatory agencies to hire an army of ML experts, so it's probably going to be mostly based on metrics that can be consumed by a bureaucracy:\r\n<ol><li>Compute:How large is the training run in floating point operations? What is the training data, and how much of it is there? How large are the models? If you have a reasonable suspicion that parameter counts are not a useful indicator, or if you expect the system's capabilities to not scale with parameter counts in a way similar to the published Chinchilla benchmark results, see Form 27-B Reporting Aberrant Scaling Behaviors for an instruction sheet on how to report nonstandard scaling behavior in detail...</li><li>Training data:Where is the training data from? Fill out form 95-P Private Information Use and Form 95-C/IP Inclusion Of Copyrighted Or Protected Work.</li><li>Capability:What is the expected capability of the system? What is the MLCCS code for the type of model you're training? If no MLCCS code matches, please fill out Form 511-47. If the model matches more than one MLCCS code, make sure to include the Expected Achievement scores for every MLCCS code. Failure to specify accurate Expected Achievement scores will result in an audit. Note that significant divergence between registered capability estimates and the deployed product may be grounds for penalties specified in Form 2210-M.</li><li>Risk assessment:What types of negative impact may the model have? Fill out Form 98-ES Ethical and Social Impacts and Form 98-EX Is Your Model Going To Kill And/Or Torture Everyone. What factors affect the estimate of these negative effects? Could any of these negative effects be amplified by estimation errors? Fill out Form 648-Q Risk Estimates Robustness Estimate. Note that failure to completely report factors which may predictably reduce the predictability of risk may be grounds for penalties specified in Form 2210-M.</li><li>Deployment target:How will the model be used? What customers will be served? Is it for in-house use, B2B services, government use, or consumer use?</li></ol>Physical audits would presumably collect documentation and evidence- including through access to physical systems- that reported architectures and training schemes are actually being used. The relatively sparse ML experts involved in the auditing process would likely be fed a bunch of the collected information to try to confirm that things add up. Realistically, an actively malicious corporation could slip some things past the regulators, but that's not really the threat model or goal of the regulation.\r\nThe main themes are:\r\n<ol><li>Collect a bunch of information,</li><li>Constrain models to be less harmful in expectation by default,</li><li>Provide a lever to intervene when things seem clearly bad,</li><li>Provide a big stick to hit companies with if they fail to accurately report expected impacts of the model (intentionally or not; probably want something close to strict liability here). This won't prevent all oopsies, and the existence of a penalty only matters if anyone exists after the oopsy, but it does give the company a more direct incentive to not oopsy.</li></ol>In other words, collect rope with which to later hang a bad actor so as to disincentivize bad actors from bad acting in the first place.\r\nConclusion\r\nUsing signed drivers to brick rogue GPUs seems like an easy lever for regulation to use. This isn't a complete solution, nor does it preclude other options, but it seems relatively easy to implement and helpful for avoiding the most egregious types of driving off a cliff.\r\nIt's conceivable that extended regulations could be built on a similar foundation. For example, it could serve as an enforcement mechanism for restricting the amount of compute per entity to directly combat resource races.[6]\r\nThe details could use a lot of refinement. I have no background in policy or governance, and I don't know what is legally realistic.\r\n<ol><li>^There are a variety of would-be competitors (plenty of smaller companies like Cerebras, but also major players from other markets like AMD and Intel), but they aren't yet taking market share from NVIDIA in the ML space.\r\nGoogle's in-house TPUs are another option, and other megacorps like Microsoft, Apple, Amazon and friends have the resources to dump on making their own designs. If NVIDIA's dominance becomes a little too extractive, the biggest customers may end up becoming competitors. Fortunately, this would still be a pretty narrow field from a regulatory perspective.\r\n</li><li>^The data center hardware does have other advantages in ML on a per-unit basis and isn't just vastly more expensive, but there is a reason why NVIDIA restricts the use of gaming-class hardware.\r\n</li><li>^I'm pretty certain this is not a novel idea, but I think it deserves some signal boosting.\r\n</li><li>^Regulation that required sending off automatic detailed technical reports of all code being executed and all data shuffled in and out would probably run into a lot of resistance, security concerns, and practical difficulties with limited upside. I could be wrong- maybe there's some use case for this kind of reporting- but it seems like \"regulators physically walk into your offices/data centers and audit the whole system at random times\" is both stronger and easier to get agreement on.\r\n</li><li>^NVIDIA has done this before in other fields. They've developed extensions that they know their competitors don't currently handle well, then push for those extensions to be added to standardized graphics APIs like DirectX, then strongly incentivize game developers to use those features aggressively. \"Wow! Look at those tessellation benchmarks, NVIDIA is sooo much better!\" and such.\r\n</li><li>^NVIDIA probably wouldn't be on board with this part!\r\n</li></ol>",

        "full_text": "(Bloomberg) -- Economists and money markets are divided over which way Australias central bank will move Tuesday as lingering price pressures and recovering home prices suggest a hike may be needed while weaker activity and rising unemployment argue for a pause.\r\nMost Read from Bloomberg\r\nAbout one-third of economists expect the Reserve Bank will raise its cash rate to 4.1% on Tuesday, including those from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Royal Bank of Canada, a Bloomberg survey of 25 analysts showed. The majority, including Commonwealth Bank of Australia, anticipate it will stand pat at 3.85%. Traders are pricing 50-50 odds.\r\nWe consider the meeting now live, said Gareth Aird, CBAs head of Australia economics, ascribing a 70% chance of a hold while acknowledging the tightening risk. The domestic economy is now showing sufficient signs of slowing.\r\nThe RBA meets ahead of the Bank of Canada, a similar economy where policy makers are also this week seen considering a rate rise, and a week before the Federal Reserve which appears likely to pause its aggressive tightening cycle. An increase by Australia would put it out of step with Asia-Pacific peers, with New Zealand signaling its rate has peaked while Korea and India have stood pat.\r\nGovernor Philip Lowe took RBA-watchers by surprise last month when he unexpectedly hiked following a pause in April. His rhetoric has also turned increasingly hawkish in recent weeks as he worries about mounting upside risks to both inflation and labor costs.\r\nLowe reiterated last week that the board will do whatever is necessary to bring consumer price gains back down to the RBAs 2-3% target, from around 7% now, as he tries to keep inflation expectations anchored.\r\nThe governors tough line came just before data showed consumer-price growth accelerated faster than expected in April. Two days after that, Australias industrial relations umpire raised the national minimum wage by 5.75%, a decision that prompted RBC and Nomura Holdings Inc. to predict a June hike.\r\nLike its global counterparts, the RBA is assessing whether policy is restrictive enough to ensure inflation returns to target within a reasonable timeframe, said Su-Lin Ong, chief economist at RBC.\r\nConsumption and domestic demand are easing, she said, but the labor market is extremely tight and wages are rising and these are more pressing for policy considerations.\r\nThose calling for a rate increase also fret that higher inflation expectations could become entrenched if not tackled with urgency given recent global experience. In addition, a resurgent housing market together with soaring rents are also threatening to further fuel prices.\r\nThe RBAs own forecasts show inflation only returning to the top of its target in mid-2025.\r\nLowe will have an opportunity to explain his decision and his broader assessment on the economy in a speech Wednesday morning in Sydney. Many economists expect the governor will signal further hikes ahead even if he decides to pause Tuesday given inflation is seen staying higher for longer.\r\nShortly after Lowes speech, the statistics bureau is due to release first-quarter gross domestic product. Economists favoring a pause say policy makers will wait to scour that data before moving again.\r\nWe believe the RBA will want to see the actual national accounts data before acting, which rules out June, said Citigroup Inc.s Josh Williamson, predicting back-to-back rate rises in July and August.\r\nAnother worry is the looming expiry of a large number of home loans fixed at record low rates during the pandemic. Around 90% of fixed mortgages rolling off this year will see repayments increase by 30% or more, RBA research shows.\r\nAustralian households are among the most leveraged in the developed world, with a debt-to-income ratio of almost 188%, underscoring the need for the RBA to tread with caution.\r\nA 4% plus cash rate will push debt servicing costs into record territory as a share of household income, said Shane Oliver, chief economist at AMP Capital Markets which is predicting a June hike.\r\n--With assistance from Garfield Reynolds and Tomoko Sato.\r\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\r\n\u00a92023 Bloomberg L.P.",

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Solar Stocks Billionaires Are Loading Up On.\u00a0\r\nBy 2024, the International Energy Agency (IEA) anticipates that the costs of generating electricity from new onshore wind and solar photovoltaic plants will decrease, but not at a sufficiently rapid pace to drop below the values observed before the Covid-19 pandemic in most markets outside of China. Although commodity and freight prices have decreased compared to the peak levels of the previous year, they still remain high. Additionally, developers are facing higher financing costs due to the rise in interest rates. Consequently, the global average levelised costs of energy (LCOEs) for onshore wind and solar PV in 2024 are expected to remain 10-15% higher than the levels recorded in 2020. The primary portion of the costs associated with generating electricity from solar PV and wind power plants is attributed to the initial investment, while the expenses related to operations and maintenance are relatively minimal. The installation of new solar PV and wind capacity is projected to result in approximately EUR 100 billion in savings for electricity consumers in the European Union between 2021 and 2023, as per the IEA report.\u00a0\r\nThe combination of inflation, the energy crisis, and increasing interest rates is placing multiple countries in dire financial distress, with bankruptcy looming over their heads unless immediate aid is offered by developed nations. This situation will likely result in loss of access to electricity for millions of people around the world. The global energy crisis has resulted in a staggering surge in the adoption of renewable energy sources. According to the International Energy Agency, the global capacity for renewable power is set to nearly double in the next five years, outranking coal as the primary source of electricity generation worldwide by early 2025. This anticipated growth is 30% higher than the previous year's forecast, illustrating the accelerated support from governments for renewable energy policies. The Economist suggests that overall renewable energy consumption will increase by approximately 11%, with Asia leading the charge.\r\nPitchBookpredicts that in the upcoming five years, the climate tech sector is expected to reach a market value of $1.4 trillion, indicating a compound annual growth rate of 8.8%. This significant growth rate is likely to capture the attention of discerning investors. Billionaires, always keen on capitalizing on profitable prospects, are enthusiastically investing in solar stocks. In the portfolios of billionaires during the first quarter of 2023, prominent solar stocks such as Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), First Solar, Inc. (NASDAQ:FSLR), and Enphase Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ENPH) have been identified.\r\nOur Methodology\u00a0\r\nInsider Monkey tracks billionaire-owned stocks and in this article, we selected the solar stocks that attracted the highest number of billionaire investors during the first quarter of 2023. We have also mentioned the overall hedge fund sentiment towards each stock as of Q1 2023.\u00a0\r\n10 Solar Stocks Billionaires Are Loading Up On\r\nPhoto by Science in HD on Unsplash\r\n10. Canadian Solar Inc. (NASDAQ:CSIQ)\r\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 17\r\nNumber of Billionaire Investors: 7\r\nCanadian Solar Inc.

(NYSE:BEP)\r\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 17\r\nNumber of Billionaire Investors: 7\r\nBrookfield Renewable Partners L.P. (NYSE:BEP) possesses a collection of renewable energy facilities located mainly in North America, Colombia, Brazil, Europe, and Asia. The companys power generation facilities encompass a variety of sources such as hydroelectric, wind, solar, distributed generation, pumped storage, cogeneration, and biomass. In Q1 2023, Brookfield Renewable Partners L.P. (NYSE:BEP) was part of 7 billionaire portfolios.

(NYSE:BEP), an underperformer in the fourth quarter, though we view Brookfields stable fundamentals (with &gt;90% of contracted cash flows having an average term of 14 years), inflation protection (~70% of power purchase agreements are indexed to inflation) and long-term growth opportunities as attractive in the current environment. Brookfields balance sheet is also relatively well-protected against rising rates given it has 97% fixed-rate debt with an average term to maturity of 12 years.\r\n8. Shoals Technologies Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:SHLS)\r\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 34\r\nNumber of Billionaire Investors: 7\r\nShoals Technologies Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:SHLS) offers solutions and components for electrical balance of system (EBOS) applications. These applications include solar energy, battery energy, and electric vehicle charging.

(NASDAQ:SHLS).\u00a0\r\nOn May 8, Shoals Technologies Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:SHLS) reported a Q1 GAAP EPS of $0.10 and a revenue of $105.09 million, outperforming Wall Street estimates by $0.04 and $7.53 million, respectively.\u00a0\r\nTruist analyst Jordan Levy raised the firm's price target on Shoals Technologies Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:SHLS) to $35 from $32 and kept a Buy rating on the shares on May 9. In a research note to investors, the analyst highlighted that Shoals Technologies Group, Inc.

The firm further suggested that the potential long-term margin profile for Shoals Technologies Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:SHLS) could exceed the current valuation of its shares.\r\nAccording to Insider Monkeys first quarter database, 34 hedge funds were bullish on Shoals Technologies Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:SHLS), compared to 32 funds in the prior quarter. Billionaire Louis Bacon's Moore Global Investments held a $27.5 million stake in the company.\u00a0\r\nClearBridge Investments made the following comment about Shoals Technologies Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:SHLS) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:\r\nShoals Technologies Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:SHLS) manufactures electrical balance of systems (EBOS) components for ground-mounted solar projects and has been gaining market share for quality of service and price. Shoals is also starting to develop an EV charging infrastructure business. We previously owned Shoals and sold our position earlier this year as supply chain issues were negatively affecting margins. Improving supply chain dynamics should support the stock, and tax credits for clean energy production and investment in the IRA should further act as a tailwind for Shoals.\r\n7. SolarEdge Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:SEDG)\r\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 42\r\nNumber of Billionaire Investors: 8\r\nSolarEdge Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:SEDG) specializes in the design, development, and commercialization of optimized inverter systems for solar photovoltaic installations. These inverter systems are specifically tailored to maximize the efficiency of direct current in solar energy generation. SolarEdge Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:SEDG) is a sought-after solar company among billionaires. In the first quarter of 2023, a total of 8 billionaires held positions in the company.\r\nOn May 24, Barclays maintained an Overweight rating on SolarEdge Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:SEDG) but reduced the price target on the shares from $392 to $390. According to the firm, SolarEdge Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:SEDG) is positioned to capture a larger portion of the market in the United States. The company's backlog provides some protection against a potential decline in the residential market in both the U.S. and Europe, as stated in the firms research note to investors.\r\nAccording to Insider Monkeys first quarter database, 42 hedge funds were bullish on SolarEdge Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:SEDG), compared to 43 funds in the prior quarter. Billionaire David Elliot Shaw's D E Shaw held the biggest stake in the company, comprising 895,709 shares worth $272.25 million.\u00a0\r\nHere is what ClearBridge International Growth EAFE Portfolio has to say about SolarEdge Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:SEDG) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:\r\nWe are well-positioned to participate in the accelerating energy transition. High and rising utility costs combined with policy support are driving increased penetration of home solar plus storage systems in Europe. Israel-based SolarEdge Technologies (NASDAQ:SEDG) expects to see significant growth in solar installations in this market led by Germany and Italy, among others, where consumers are not only demanding solar on the roof but a complete system solution including batteries. This phenomenon is accelerating revenue growth for these companies.\r\n6. Array Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:ARRY)\r\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 31\r\nNumber of Billionaire Investors: 9\r\nArray Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:ARRY) is a company that produces and markets ground-mounting tracking systems for solar energy projects worldwide. On May 9, Array Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:ARRY) reported a Q1 non-GAAP EPS of $0.25 and a revenue of $376.8 million, outperforming Wall Street estimates by $0.21 and $54.26 million, respectively.\u00a0\r\nOn May 22, Piper Sandler analyst Kashy Harrison increased the price target for Array Technologies, Inc.

The firm generally holds a positive view on domestic content guidance for the industry.\r\nAccording to Insider Monkeys first quarter database, 31 hedge funds were bullish on Array Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:ARRY), compared to 36 funds in the prior quarter. Additionally, 9 billionaires held stakes in the company as of March end, including billionaire Steve Cohen.\u00a0\r\nArray Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:ARRY) is among the preferred solar picks of billionaires, along with Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), First Solar, Inc. (NASDAQ:FSLR), and Enphase Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ENPH).\r\nBaron Discovery Fund published its Q2 2021 investor letter and mentioned Array Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:ARRY). Here is what the fund said:\u00a0\r\nArray Technologies, Inc., a leading manufacturer of solar trackers, fell during the quarter after management rescinded guidance due to uncertainty around rapidly rising steel costs. Our understanding at the time of the companys IPO in October 2020, was that Array fixed input costs at the same time as its sales contracts were signed, thereby eliminating commodity pricing risk. However, this quarter management noted that a lag of just a few days between these events led to significant pricing mis-matches due to the extreme volatility in steel pricing during that period. This disrupted not only Array, but the entire contracting complex around large solar projects. Contracts relating to these projects had to be renegotiated across the board, leading to multiple quarter delays in revenue recognition. Further, our due diligence has indicated that while the company has terrific products, it might be falling behind its competitors from an innovation standpoint, increasing our concerns that the company will not reach its market penetration goals. For these reasons we sold the investment in the quarter.\r\nClick to continue reading and see 5 Solar Stocks Billionaires Are Loading Up On.\u00a0\r\n Suggested articles:\r\nDisclosure: None.\u00a010 Solar Stocks Billionaires Are Loading Up On\u00a0is originally published on Insider Monkey.",

        "full_text": "RADNOR, Pa., June 04, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The law firm of Kessler Topaz Meltzer &amp; Check, LLP (www.ktmc.com) informs investors that a securities class action lawsuit has been filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania against Viatris Inc. (Viatris) (NASDAQ:VTRS). The action charges Viatris with violations of the federal securities laws, including omissions and fraudulent misrepresentations relating to the companys business, operations, and prospects. As a result of Viatris materially misleading statements and omissions to the public, Viatris investors have suffered significant losses.\r\nCLICK HERE TO SUBMIT YOUR VIATRIS LOSSES.

Our securities fraud litigators are regularly recognized as leaders in the field individually and our firm is both feared and respected among the defense bar and the insurance bar. We are proud to have recovered billions of dollars for our clients and the classes of shareholders we represent.\r\nVIATRIS ALLEGED MISCONDUCTAt the outset of the Class Period, Viatris announced a multi-phase plan, the first phase of which that would allow it to: (1) create a stable revenue base; (2) realize $1 billion in cost synergies by 2024; and (3) improve cash conversion and free cash flow generation. Defendants claimed that Viatris would achieve its first phase goals through its strong pipeline of new products, including those in its biosimilars business. Defendants further represented that Viatris strong pipeline and business development would offset erosion of the companys base business.\r\nHowever, contrary to Defendants representations, the company was experiencing significantly more competition in its United States complex generics business than disclosed. As a result, the company was not able to effectively manage its base business erosion or create a stable revenue base. Instead, throughout 2021, Viatris total revenues were declining quarter-over-quarter.\r\nOn February 28, 2022, before the market opened, Viatris revealed that it had decided to undertake a global reshaping of its business, announcing that it had entered into an agreement to sell its biosimilars business to Biocon Biologics Limited, and that it was seeking to divest additional business assets to focus on developing products in three core therapeutic areas as part of its reshaping. The same day, Viatris also announced disappointing guidance for fiscal year 2022, attributing the lower-than-expected numbers to competition around key core products and price deterioration in certain markets.\r\nFollowing this news, Viatris stock price fell $3.53, or 24.3%, to close at $11.01 per share on February 28, 2022.\r\nWHAT CAN I DO?Viatris investors may, no later than July 14, 2023,\r\n move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff for the class, through Kessler Topaz Meltzer &amp; Check, LLP or other counsel, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member.

        "full_text": "Key Insights\r\n<ul><li>The considerable ownership by private equity firms in Trevi Therapeutics indicates that they collectively have a greater say in management and business strategy\r\n</li><li>A total of 5 investors have a majority stake in the company with 56% ownership\r\n</li><li> Institutions own 17% of Trevi Therapeutics\r\n</li></ul>To get a sense of who is truly in control of Trevi Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:TRVI), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. We can see that private equity firms own the lion's share in the company with 35% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.\r\nHedge funds, on the other hand, account for 32% of the company's stockholders.\r\nLet's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Trevi Therapeutics.\r\n View our latest analysis for Trevi Therapeutics \r\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Trevi Therapeutics?\r\nInstitutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.\r\nWe can see that Trevi Therapeutics does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Trevi Therapeutics' earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.\r\nearnings-and-revenue-growth\r\nIt looks like hedge funds own 32% of Trevi Therapeutics shares. That's interesting, because hedge funds can be quite active and activist. Many look for medium term catalysts that will drive the share price higher. New Enterprise Associates, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 19% of shares outstanding. With 11% and 9.5% of the shares outstanding respectively, Frazier Life Sciences Management, LP and Fairmount Funds Management LLC are the second and third largest shareholders.\r\nTo make our study more interesting, we found that the top 5 shareholders control more than half of the company which implies that this group has considerable sway over the company's decision-making.\r\nResearching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.\r\nInsider Ownership Of Trevi Therapeutics\r\nThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.\r\nInsider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.\r\nWe can see that insiders own shares in Trevi Therapeutics, Inc.. As individuals, the insiders collectively own US$4.9m worth of the US$135m company. It is good to see some investment by insiders, but we usually like to see higher insider holdings. It might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. \r\nGeneral Public Ownership\r\nThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 12% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.\r\nPrivate Equity Ownership\r\nWith an ownership of 35%, private equity firms are in a position to play a role in shaping corporate strategy with a focus on value creation. Sometimes we see private equity stick around for the long term, but generally speaking they have a shorter investment horizon and -- as the name suggests -- don't invest in public companies much. After some time they may look to sell and redeploy capital elsewhere.\r\nNext Steps:\r\nI find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Be aware that Trevi Therapeutics is showing 5 warning signs in our investment analysis, and 3 of those are concerning...\r\nIf you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink. Luckily, you can check this free report showing analyst forecasts for its future.\r\nNB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

        "file_name": "2023-06-04_62349830.txt",
        "full_text": "What happened\r\nShares of leading-edge foundry Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing(TSM 0.10%) and its equipment suppliers ASML Holdings(ASML -0.29%) and KLA Corporation(KLAC 1.22%) rallied during the month of May, rising 11.2%, 17.1%, and 14.6%, respectively, according to data from S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence.\u00a0All three companies reported earnings in April, but second-quarter guidance from Nvidia(NVDA -1.11%) on May 24 lifted all three stocks, as each of these names plays a key role in manufacturing Nvidia's chips.\r\nGiven the high enthusiasm over Nvidia's guidance and the outlook for strong multiyear growth in artificial intelligence (AI) applications, it's no surprise these chip manufacturing stocks were riding high last month...and it looks as if the positive trend may continue.\r\nSo what\r\nOn May 24, Nvidia reported its first-quarter earnings. While its Q1 earnings came in above expectations, it was really management's blowout second-quarter guidance that catapulted the stock higher along with other related semiconductor names.\r\nAI\u00a0technology and capability seem to have hit a tipping point, leading to a rush of investment by large enterprises and start-ups to capitalize on these newfound capabilities. While the release of ChatGPT last November seemed to have jump-started awareness, it appears massive investments are now kicking in about six months later.\r\nThat should be a boon for sales of AI-related chips, especially leading-edge Nvidia GPUs. And if the AI investment tsunami is good for Nvidia, it will also be good for TSMC, which manufactures the vast majority of the world's leading-edge semiconductors, Nvidia H100s included.\r\nIn fact, there were reports from as far back as March from industry publication DigiTimes that TSMC was seeing Nvidia ramp its pace of orders. However, with the overall semiconductor downturn outside of AI chips ongoing, there wasn't much talk of a surge in TSMC's growth back then.\r\nHowever, with Nvidia's guidance and a May 26 DigiTimes report saying TSMC was now seeing a surge of \"super hot runs (SHR)\" for Nvidia chips, TSMC's stock finally responded. While AI servers make up less than 10% of today's overall server market, TSMC's skew toward the most advanced leading-edge chips is likely helping the stock defy the broader downturn.\r\nWhile Nvidia depends on TSMC's manufacturing capabilities, TSMC, in turn, depends on ASML, which has a monopoly on key extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography technology needed to make any chip node below 10nm. In addition, the production of leading-edge chips is heavy on the use of metrology, or process control, which measures the accuracy of chip transistor layers and other parameters through every step of the mind-bogglingly complex process. KLA Corporation is the dominant leader in process control, with over 50% market share.\r\nSo it wasn't surprising to see both ASML and KLA Corporation rallying along with TSMC. After all, each stock is much cheaper than Nvidia, and neither has clawed its way back to the late 2021/early 2022 highs yet.\r\nTSM Percent Off All-Time High data by YCharts. PE Ratio = price-to-earnings ratio.\r\nNow what\r\nTo that last point, the semiconductor industry is at an interesting point right now. While experiencing the worst-ever decline in PCs, one of the worst-ever declines in smartphones, and softness in general computing servers, there is also solid growth in auto and industrial chips. And we appear to be at the beginning of a boom in AI servers.\r\nThe semiconductor sector is notoriously cyclical, but it's projected to grow faster than the economy through this decade, largely due to the megatrends of AI and electrification. Given that we now may be at the bottom of the post-pandemic bear market in semis, it's probably not too late to buy the stocks of leading chip manufacturers and equipment providers, with an eye toward the long term. While Nvidia trades at a frothy-looking 200 times earnings, these other AI plays don't.",

        "full_text": "India's largest carrier IndiGo is all set to potentially close in on a record deal with Airbus to sell 500 narrow-body A320-family jets, according to industry sources on Sunday. The company has emerged as the front-runner for the order and the order eclipses Air India's provisional purchase of nearly 470 jets in February, according to a source on the sidelines of the airline industry meet in Istanbul. \r\nSuch a deal would be worth some $50 billion at the most recently published Airbus list prices, but would typically be worth less than half this after widespread airline industry discounts for bulk deals, according to aircraft analysts.Airbus and Boeing are also competing in separate talks to sell 25 A330neo or Boeing 787 wide-body jets to the same airline, they said.IndiGo Chief Executive Pieter Elbers, attending the annual meeting of the International Air Transport Association in Istanbul, declined to comment on commercial matters.\r\nAirbus and Boeing also declined to comment.IndiGo, which has a 56% share of the domestic Indian market, was in talks with both Airbus and Boeing for the order, which if confirmed would be the largest by a single airline ranked by units.IndiGo's potential new order comes as it is yet to take delivery of nearly 500 jets out of a total order of 830 Airbus A320-family planes, making it one of the largest customers of the European group.During the airline industry meet in Istanbul, the head of a group representing global airlines renewed pressure on plane makers to speed up plane and parts production on Sunday, warning the delays would curtail airline capacity as demand for air travel nears a full recovery from the pandemic.\r\nAirbus and Boeing have blamed supply chains for delivery delays, while bottlenecks in a network of engine repair shops have also forced airlines to ground dozens of jets.\r\nAirbus and Boeing have been racking up billions of dollars of new orders stretching beyond 2030 as airlines lock in supplies well ahead amid looming shortages.\r\n(With inputs from Reuters)\r\nDon\u2019t miss out on ET Prime stories!

Shes a bride of Christ, and nothing else matters.\r\n'I did a double take'\r\nThe Benedictine community exhumed Sister Wilhelmina, almost four years after her death, after deciding to move her remains to a new St. Josephs Shrine inside the abbeys church, a common custom to honor the founders of religious orders, the sisters said.\r\nMembers of the community did the digging themselves, \"a little bit each day,\" Mother Cecilia said. The process began on April 26 and culminated with a half-dozen or so sisters using straps to haul the coffin out of the ground on April 28.\r\nThe abbess revealed that there was a feeling of anticipation among the sisters to see what was inside the coffin.\r\n\"There was a sense that maybe God would do something special because she was so special and so pure of heart,\" Mother Cecilia said.\r\nIt was the abbess who looked through the cracked lid first, shining her flashlight into the dark coffin.\r\n\"So I looked and I kind of did a double take and I kind of stepped back. 'Did I just see what I think I saw? Because I think I just saw a completely full foot with a black sock still on it,'\" she recalled saying to herself.\r\nMembers of the Benedictines of Mary, Queen of Apostles, lead a procession with the body of their foundress, Sister Wilhelmina Lancaster, at their abbey in Gower, Missouri, on May 29, 2023. Joe Bukuras/CNA\r\nSister Wilhelmina's features were clearly recognizable; even her eyebrows and eyelashes were still there, the sisters discovered. Not only that, but her Hanes-brand socks, her brown scapular, Miraculous Medal, rosary beads, profession candle, and the ribbon around the candle none of it had deteriorated.\r\nThe crown of flowers placed on her head for her burial had survived, too, dried in place but still visible. Yet the coffins fabric lining, the sisters noted, had disintegrated.

        "file_name": "2023-06-04_62349769.txt",
        "full_text": "We feel now is a pretty good time to analyse Amicus Therapeutics, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:FOLD) business as it appears the company may be on the cusp of a considerable accomplishment. Amicus Therapeutics, Inc., a biotechnology company, focuses on discovering, developing, and delivering medicines for rare diseases. The US$3.5b market-cap companys loss lessened since it announced a US$237m loss in the full financial year, compared to the latest trailing-twelve-month loss of US$204m, as it approaches breakeven. The most pressing concern for investors is Amicus Therapeutics' path to profitability when will it breakeven? We've put together a brief outline of industry analyst expectations for the company, its year of breakeven and its implied growth rate.\r\n View our latest analysis for Amicus Therapeutics \r\nConsensus from 12 of the American Biotechs analysts is that Amicus Therapeutics is on the verge of breakeven. They expect the company to post a final loss in 2023, before turning a profit of US$43m in 2024. The company is therefore projected to breakeven just over a year from today. How fast will the company have to grow each year in order to reach the breakeven point by 2024? Working backwards from analyst estimates, it turns out that they expect the company to grow 66% year-on-year, on average, which is extremely buoyant. Should the business grow at a slower rate, it will become profitable at a later date than expected.\r\nearnings-per-share-growth\r\nWe're not going to go through company-specific developments for Amicus Therapeutics given that this is a high-level summary, however, bear in mind that typically biotechs, depending on the stage of product development, have irregular periods of cash flow. This means that a high growth rate is not unusual, especially if the company is currently in an investment period.\r\nOne thing we would like to bring into light with Amicus Therapeutics is its debt-to-equity ratio of over 2x. Generally, the rule of thumb is debt shouldnt exceed 40% of your equity, and the company has considerably exceeded this. A higher level of debt requires more stringent capital management which increases the risk in investing in the loss-making company.\r\nThere are key fundamentals of Amicus Therapeutics which are not covered in this article, but we must stress again that this is merely a basic overview. For a more comprehensive look at Amicus Therapeutics, take a look at Amicus Therapeutics' company page on Simply Wall St. We've also compiled a list of relevant factors you should further research:\r\n<ol><li>Valuation: What is Amicus Therapeutics worth today?

This is the money that everyday citizens, firefighters, police officers, doctors, who generally have their money either [in] 401ks or, in a lot of cases, large pension funds, large pension funds like the State of California, which manages the largest pension fund in the U.S. and the State of New York and then European pension funds as well. And a lot of the politicians in those states, in California, for example, they recently have mandated those large pension funds that they divest from things like fossil fuels and oil and gas, and then when Bill de Blasio (D), Mayor of New York was there, he did the same thing. But they also tell BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard, if theyre going to manage their money, they have to commit to things like ESG, diversity, equity, and inclusion and adopt firm-wide commitments that they, therefore, then force onto all the major companies in corporate America.\r\n(Excerpt) Read more at breitbart.com ...\r\nTOPICS:Culture/Society; GovernmentKEYWORDS:\r\nDear FRiends, We need your help to get this FReepathon moving.Your loyal support makes Free Republic possible.

        "file_name": "2023-06-04_62349759.txt",
        "full_text": "With the business potentially at an important milestone, we thought we'd take a closer look at G1 Therapeutics, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:GTHX) future prospects. G1 Therapeutics, Inc., a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company, engages in the discovery, development, and commercialization of small molecule therapeutics for the treatment of patients with cancer. The US$135m market-cap companys loss lessened since it announced a US$148m loss in the full financial year, compared to the latest trailing-twelve-month loss of US$126m, as it approaches breakeven. The most pressing concern for investors is G1 Therapeutics' path to profitability when will it breakeven? Below we will provide a high-level summary of the industry analysts expectations for the company.\r\n Check out our latest analysis for G1 Therapeutics \r\nG1 Therapeutics is bordering on breakeven, according to the 8 American Biotechs analysts. They anticipate the company to incur a final loss in 2024, before generating positive profits of US$91m in 2025. So, the company is predicted to breakeven approximately 2 years from today. What rate will the company have to grow year-on-year in order to breakeven on this date? Using a line of best fit, we calculated an average annual growth rate of 50%, which is extremely buoyant. Should the business grow at a slower rate, it will become profitable at a later date than expected.\r\nearnings-per-share-growth\r\nGiven this is a high-level overview, we wont go into details of G1 Therapeutics' upcoming projects, however, bear in mind that typically biotechs, depending on the stage of product development, have irregular periods of cash flow. So, a high growth rate is not out of the ordinary, particularly when a company is in a period of investment.\r\nOne thing we would like to bring into light with G1 Therapeutics is its debt-to-equity ratio of 172%. Typically, debt shouldnt exceed 40% of your equity, which in this case, the company has significantly overshot. Note that a higher debt obligation increases the risk around investing in the loss-making company.\r\nThere are too many aspects of G1 Therapeutics to cover in one brief article, but the key fundamentals for the company can all be found in one place G1 Therapeutics' company page on Simply Wall St. We've also put together a list of relevant factors you should further examine:\r\n<ol><li>Valuation: What is G1 Therapeutics worth today?

        "file_name": "2023-06-04_62349840.txt",
        "full_text": "Man relaxing on beach, ocean view, Maldives island\r\ngetty\r\nTo retire on dividends, we have just two requirements. They are simple, though perhaps not exactly easy:\r\n<ol><li>Earn safe, meaningful yields. Five percent is our floor, thirteen is our stretch goal. Well discuss five stocks in this dividend range shortly.</li><li>Keep our principal intact. To do this well focus on low beta stocksshares that move less than the broader market.</li></ol>Beta says how much (or how little!) an investment moves compared to some benchmark. With stocks, beta is usually going to measure movement against the S&amp;P 500.\r\nHeres an example. Lets say a stock has a beta of 0.50. That means, broadly speaking, when the S&amp;P 500 drops by 1% in a day, the stock will probably only drop by 0.50%. Its not a perfect relationshipit wont work out that way exactly on a daily basisbut over time, lower-beta stocks typically have much calmer stock movement.\r\nLets highlight five low-vol payerswith dividends between 5% and 12.8%that can provide long-term stability while funding our payout-powered retirements.\r\nLow-Vol High Yielders\r\nAmcor plc (AMCR, 5.0% yield) is an out-of-the-ordinary safety pick, largely because its part of the heavily cyclical materials sector and its tied pretty closely with consumer companies.\r\nThing is, Amcor makes packaging. Shrink bags, lidding films, custom bottle caps, you name it. That means weakness in any one consumer category isnt necessarily going to punish AMCR. Weakness in a lot of consumer categories, however:\r\nSure, some of AMCRs weakness can be chalked up to difficult comps as well as lost business in Russia. But the real problem is weaker consumer demand, which analysts expect could persist through at least next year. Amcor has been aggressively cost-cutting in response, however, trimming $140 million so far this year and gunning for as much as $60 million by the end of the fiscal year.\r\nAmcor could get worse before it gets better. But its a 5% yielder whose one- and five-year betas both stand at 0.85, which is modestly less volatile than the broader market. And its a Dividend Aristocrat to boot, boasting four consecutive decades of uninterrupted payout growth.\r\nInternational Business Machines (IBM, 5.2% yield) is a younger Aristocrat with 28 consecutive years of annual dividend hikes. It also sports a 0.85 five-year beta, and its been even calmer more recently, with a one-year beta of 0.62.\r\nIBM, like many large firms, recently announced a slew of artificial intelligence (AI) initiatives. Its the Wild West out here, and given the disappointment of IBMs Watson, its fair to be at least a little skeptical over the potential for its AI WatsonX Platform. But given AIs heralded quality of being a massive job killer (er, redundancy-eliminator), IBM could see some pickup. Heck, the company thinks it can eliminate 28,000 of its own employees with the technology.\r\nDown the road, that might be a worry for Philip Morris International (PM, 5.6% yield)after all, robots dont smoke (or consume anything, for that matter). For now, shareholders primary concern is weak second-quarter guidance that sent shares off track:\r\nEven then, the tobacco giant is guiding for high-single-digit organic sales and profit growth this year, with most of it relying on a pivot in the second half. Especially promising is growth in the companys heated and oral tobacco lineup.\r\nMeanwhile, shares are cheaper than most of PMs consumer staple peers, the yield is well north of 5%, and one- and five-year betas of 0.75 and 0.71, respectively, reflect continued relative stability that investors should expect going forward, too.\r\nOmega Healthcare Investors (OHI, 9.0%) screams for a second look based on yield alone. This real estate investment trust (REIT) is a triple-net lease firm that provides financing and capital solutions to operating partners in the skilled nursing facility and assisted living facility industries.\r\nLike the rest of its industry, Omega was hammered during the pandemic. COVID wreaked havoc through nursing homes and assisted living, dragging related REITs lower by 50%, 60%, 70%, sometimes more. And while shares have stabilized over the past year or so, OHI still is worth less than two-thirds what it was at its pre-COVID peak. And its dividend of late has outstripped funds from operations (FFO) and funds available for distribution (FAD).\r\nThose with patience might prevail. Omega still has a healthy balance sheet, and the business is finally seeing some light at the end of the tunnel. OHI has concluded with a series of restructurings, and rent is flowing in from those tenants once more. The stock is stabilizing, tooits five-year beta is just a hair under 1.0, but OHI has been less than half as volatile as the market over the past year.\r\nA brisk takeoff ahead? Maybe not. But most of Omegas problems are no longer on the horizon, but in the rear-view mirror.\r\nFashion is fickle, but that has worked to Buckles (BKE, 12.8%) advantage over the past couple of years. The fashion retailer of mid- to higher-end clothes, accessories and footwear has become trendy once more, leading to an operational renaissance of late.\r\nThe good news? Buckle technically has been less volatile than the market over the past year and the past half-decade. But the stock is slumping hard because its looking like a binge in denim and other Buckle staples was merely unleashed pent-up demand. The current years profits are expected to taper back by 13% YoY, then remain level in 2024.\r\nBut, oh, that dividend, right? At nearly 13% (from a retailer, no less), who could resist?\r\nIts a bit deceiving. The majority of that yield is a reflection of the companys special dividend. BKEs regular dividend comes out to about 4.4%; the rest came from Buckles most recent special payout.\r\nTo be fair, though, BKE has compiled a history of special dividends over the past few years, delivering a decent baseline, then topping out as much as it can, when it can. Investors have enjoyed extra payouts roughly once a year for some time now.\r\nBrett Owens is chief investment strategist for Contrarian Outlook.

A list of closed parks and forests is available on the government's website\r\n.\r\nThe ministry says it is necessary to restrict access to forests to lower the risk of new fires and to help make firefighting operations easier.\r\nThe risk of new forest fires is also prompting the agency that manages Quebec's provincial parks network, the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des \u00e9tablissements de plein air du Qu\u00e9bec (SEPAQ), to ban or limit access to 13 of its parks.

Val d'Or has declared a state of emergency.\r\nThe city issued an evacuation order for people living in the sectors of Louvicourt, Lac Wyeth, Lac Gu\u00e9guen, Lac Matchi-Manitou and Lac Villebon, \"given that two out-of-control fires are raging on the east side of the Louvicourt sector and due to poor air quality,\" it said in a news release.\r\nEvacuees can head over to the Fournier Multisport Center, which is also sheltering people from the Anishinaabe Nation of Lac Simon and the Algonquin community of Kiticisakik forced to leave their homes Saturday.\r\nThose in Val d'Or's urban core are not affected by the evacuation notice as fires don't threaten the area, though the air quality is still considered very bad and residents are encouraged to stay indoors.\r\nThe town of Norm\u00e9tal in Abitibi-Ouest is also under an evacuation order. Officials redirected the 754 residents south of the town to either Dupuy or La Sarre.\r\nIn total, about 14,000 people have been forced to leave their homes in communities near forest fires, including Sept-\u00celes on Quebec's North Shore, the neighbouring Innu community of Mani-Utenam and Lebel-sur-Qu\u00e9villon in Northern Quebec.\r\nThe city of Sept-\u00celes has renewed a local state of emergency for five days, but no new evacuations will take place Sunday.\r\nEvacuation notices for the Moisie, Les Plages and Lac Daigle sectors will be\u00a0maintained for at least another 24 hours.\u00a0 \r\nMayor of Sept-\u00celes\u00a0Steeve Beaupr\u00e9\u00a0says he\u00a0doesn't want people to return to their homes and have to be evacuated again.

        "full_text": "Quebec's forestry ministry banned access to more forests and closed roads as of 8 a.m. Sunday as fires continue to burn across the province.\r\nAccess to forests in northern Quebec, C\u00f4te-Nord, Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean, Abitibi-T\u00e9miscamingue, Mauricie, Outaouais, Lanaudi\u00e8re and the Laurentians are limited. A list of closed parks and forests is available on the government's website\r\n.\r\nThe ministry says it is necessary to restrict access to forests to lower the risk of new fires and to help make firefighting operations easier.\r\nThe risk of new forest fires is also prompting the agency that manages Quebec's provincial parks network, the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des \u00e9tablissements de plein air du Qu\u00e9bec (SEPAQ), to ban or limit access to 13 of its parks. They include the La V\u00e9rendrye and the Laurentides wildlife reserves, and a full list of closed parks\r\n is available.\r\nVal d'Or and a nearby town in Abitibi-Ouest are the latest municipalities to proceed with evacuations because of the forest fires. Val d'Or has declared a state of emergency.\r\nThe city issued an evacuation order for people living in the sectors of Louvicourt, Lac Wyeth, Lac Gu\u00e9guen, Lac Matchi-Manitou and Lac Villebon, \"given that two out-of-control fires are raging on the east side of the Louvicourt sector and due to poor air quality,\" it said in a news release.\r\nEvacuees can head over to the Fournier Multisport Center, which is also sheltering people from the Anishinaabe Nation of Lac Simon and the Algonquin community of Kiticisakik forced to leave their homes Saturday.\r\nThose in Val d'Or's urban core are not affected by the evacuation notice as fires don't threaten the area, though the air quality is still considered very bad and residents are encouraged to stay indoors.\r\nThe town of Norm\u00e9tal in Abitibi-Ouest is also under an evacuation order. Officials redirected the 754 residents south of the town to either Dupuy or La Sarre.\r\nIn total, about 14,000 people have been forced to leave their homes in communities near forest fires, including Sept-\u00celes on Quebec's North Shore, the neighbouring Innu community of Mani-Utenam and Lebel-sur-Qu\u00e9villon in Northern Quebec.\r\nQuebec's public security minister is holding a news conference on the forest fire situation at 10 a.m.",

But if we build those homes using traditional approaches of the past four decades, we risk adding 20 per cent more emissions to a footprint thats already the third largest in Canada.\r\nFinancial Post Top Stories\r\nSign up to receive the daily top stories from the Financial Post, a division of Postmedia Network Inc.\r\n By clicking on the sign up button you consent to receive the above newsletter from Postmedia Network Inc.

Please try again \r\nArticle content\r\nHow quickly we address these colliding challenges will be defining for all Canadians and thats why we need a new greenprint that changes how we design, construct, renovate and heat our buildings. And well need leadership from every corner of Canada government at all levels, property developers, energy producers, cement and steel makers, cleantech entrepreneurs and more.\r\nProgress is being made. The recent launch of the Brookfield Sustainability Institute at George Brown College featured developers who are implementing sustainable building approaches to homes and condos, and insights from banks like Royal Bank of Canada who are examining new financial mechanisms to advance green building.\r\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. \r\nArticle content\r\nAnd with governments focusing more on affordable housing, we are seeing new collaboration opportunities to de-risk technologies, forge partnerships, and create incentives to make sustainability the industry norm.\r\nSo, how do we build on this progress?\r\nThe first place to start is how we power our homes. Here, Canada is, to borrow a building term, at a hinge point. We rely on an abundance of natural gas for our homes and, despite heat pumps being a low-emissions alternative, it is not yet cost effective for Canadians to install one. Clean electricity regulations coming this summer will significantly change that. But if we electrify buildings in the wrong way, we risk shocking the system with dramatic increases in electricity rates for Canadians who already struggling with affordability.\r\nArticle content\r\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. \r\nArticle content\r\nTo ease the cost of the transition on Canadians, every province must find ways to generate and transmit more electricity at lower costs and with fewer emissions. Thankfully, Canada is a leader in researching new electricity generation technology, so accelerating these technologies to market will be crucial.\r\nWe can then examine the materials used to build buildings cement, steel, and the like, which account for as much as 30 per cent of a buildings overall carbon footprint. These materials can also add nearly two decades of emissions to the operation of the building.\r\nBecause Canada is among the worlds leaders in green steel and other sustainable construction materials, we have options. A new wave of mass timber projects, led by Limberlost Place on George Brown Colleges downtown waterfront campus, is showing the promise of net-zero buildings. Carbicrete in Montreal is taking one of Canadas most stubborn emissions challenges concrete and turning it into a powerful carbon sink. Mattamy Homes Springwater community in Markham, Ont., is completely net zero ready, featuring homes heated and cooled using geo-exchange technology that reduces emissions by 75 per cent.\r\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. \r\nArticle content\r\nWell need more of this ambition but under current codes and legislation, putting these projects into action requires exemptions and modifications that add time and money to a project.\r\nAmbitious changes to zoning and codes could spur the development of new communities, closer to mass transit, with smaller, more affordable starter homes. Theyd offer more sustainable houses to more Canadians, revitalizing urban communities rather than enabling suburban sprawl.\r\nChanges like these can also enable provinces and cities to better support builders and their suppliers in making using low-emissions materials new and recycled business as usual. For inspiration, we can look to Europe where the EU-wide building reporting tool is harmonizing approaches and concepts across the continent. And, Paris, with the 2024 Summer Olympics approaching, passed a law to ensure that all new public buildings will be built with at least 50 per cent timber or sustainable materials.\r\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. \r\nArticle content\r\nThe federal government is leading the way with green procurement standards that can help address the embodied emissions of buildings. With more funding, co-ordination and support, that thinking can enhance the effectiveness of programs like Buyers for Climate Action so it can be easier for provinces and cities to adopt and implement green procurement policies.\r\nWe neednt limit our imagination to just new builds. The countrys catalogue of aging hospitals, schools, public housing and offices gives us a readymade opportunity to scale the retrofit economy in Canada. Toronto is showing its leadership with programs like Taking Action on Tower Renewal. The initiative dedicates millions of dollars to implement retrofits that reduce emissions and improve affordability, while protecting tenants from rent increases or renovictions.\r\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. \r\nArticle content\r\nThe countrys major pension funds, which oversee vast portfolios of shopping malls, office towers and apartment blocks, can take more ownership of the challenge, too. One example: Quadreal, an arm of the BC Investment Management Corp., is using data from carbon audits not energy audits to inform property level transition plans in its own portfolio. Its then sharing that data with industry partners and peers to drive the industry towards net zero.\r\nWell still need more. Successive federal and provincial governments have offered tax breaks for energy retrofits. And yet, demand has usually fallen short of expectations. As Canadians look toward 2030, and an ambitious national target of emissions cuts, we all have a greater role to play, whether its investing in heat pumps, demanding cleaner fuels from our gas suppliers, or scrutinizing solar panels the way we do marble countertops.\r\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. \r\nArticle content\r\nThese challenges inspired the RBC Climate Action Institute to team up with the Brookfield Sustainability Institute to map out the costs of inaction and benefits of getting to work. Our research report, High Rise, Low Carbon, estimates that it will cost Canada tens of billions of dollars each year. Plenty of jobs and economic activity will come with that transition, but we need new ways to finance that investment and scale the technologies that can accelerate change. Using these insights, we have launched a climate-smart buildings coalition with EllisDon and Mattamy Homes to put ideas into action that others can copy and improve.\r\nThis may seem like a daunting challenge when so many of the worlds emissions come from elsewhere but thats never stopped Canadians from showing the world what sustainable, livable, and beautiful communities can look like. Weve produced legendary architects like Frank Ghery, transformative developers like Brookfield Corp., bold civic ambitions like Montreals Habitat 67, and we staged the first green Olympics in Vancouver in 2010.\r\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. \r\nArticle content\r\n<ol><li>\r\n Cement manufacturers offer up interesting plan to cut emissions \r\n</li><li>\r\n Edmonton picked for the worlds first net-zero cement plant \r\n</li></ol>\r\nWe may be on a collision course but Canadas reputation of innovation and leadership are recognized around the world. This spirit of sustainable innovation has helped us make some of the worlds harshest environments livable and appealing to millions from around the world. We will need that creativity and gumption more than ever, as we take on the greatest building projects of our time.\r\n John Stackhouse is senior vice-president in the Office of the CEO at Royal Bank of Canada, leading the organizations research and thought leadership on economic, technological and social change.

        "full_text": "ImmunoGen Inc. (Nasdaq: IMGN), a leader in the expanding field of antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) for the treatment of cancer, today announced detailed results from the Phase 3 confirmatory MIRASOL trial (GOG 3045/ENGOT OV-55) evaluating the safety and efficacy of ELAHERE\u00ae (mirvetuximab soravtansine-gynx) compared to chemotherapy in patients with folate receptor alpha (FR\u03b1)-positive platinum-resistant ovarian cancer (PROC). The results are being presented by Dr. Kathleen Moore in a late-breaking oral abstract session today at the 2023 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting in Chicago, Illinois. These data have also been selected for the 2023 Best of ASCO program, which will be held this summer following the ASCO Annual Meeting.\r\n\"I am thrilled to share these impressive results from the confirmatory MIRASOL trial at ASCO, which further demonstrate the potential of ELAHERE to become the new standard of care for patients with FR\u03b1-positive PROC,\" said Kathleen Moore, Associate Director of Clinical Research and Director of the Oklahoma TSET/Sarah Cannon Phase I Program, Professor of the Section of Gynecologic Oncology at The University of Oklahoma and MIRASOL Principal Investigator. \"As we saw in the top-line data announced last month, ELAHERE demonstrated an improvement versus chemotherapy across all efficacy endpoints and, importantly, is the first treatment to show an overall survival benefit in this patient population. The 33% reduction in the risk of death, along with the differentiated and well-characterized safety profile seen in MIRASOL, reinforce the potential of ELAHERE to serve as a transformative option for ovarian cancer patients and change how this disease is treated.\"\r\nMIRASOL is a randomized Phase 3 trial of ELAHERE versus investigator's choice (IC) of single-agent chemotherapy (weekly paclitaxel, pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, or topotecan). Eligibility criteria include patients with PROC whose tumors express high levels of FR\u03b1, using the Ventana FOLR1 Assay, and who have been treated with up to three prior regimens. The primary endpoint of this trial is progression-free survival (PFS) by investigator assessment. Key secondary endpoints include objective response rate (ORR) and overall survival (OS).\r\nMIRASOL enrolled 453 patients. Patients were stratified by number of prior lines of therapy (14% had one prior line of therapy, 40% had two prior lines of therapy, and 46% had three prior lines of therapy) and by IC chemotherapy, with paclitaxel as the most commonly chosen (41%), followed by PLD (36%) and topotecan (23%). 62% of patients received prior bevacizumab; 55% received a prior PARP inhibitor. As of the data cutoff on March 6, 2023, the median follow-up time for OS was 13.1 months; 14% of patients on the ELAHERE arm remained on study drug compared to 3% on the IC chemotherapy arm.\r\n<ul><li>\r\nELAHERE demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in PFS by investigator assessment compared to IC chemotherapy, with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.65 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.52, 0.81; p&lt;0.0001), which represents a 35% reduction in the risk of tumor progression or death in the ELAHERE arm compared to the IC chemotherapy arm. The median PFS in the ELAHERE arm was 5.62 months (95% CI: 4.34, 5.95) compared to 3.98 months (95% CI: 2.86, 4.47) in the IC chemotherapy arm.\r\n</li><li>\r\nELAHERE demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in OS compared to IC chemotherapy.

We look forward to submitting the MAA and sBLA for ELAHERE in the EU and US, respectively, during the second half of the year, and to progressing the broader ELAHERE development program as we work to deliver this biomarker-directed ADC to eligible patients.\"\r\nIn November 2022, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted accelerated approval for ELAHERE for the treatment of adult patients with FR\u03b1-positive, platinum-resistant epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who have received one to three prior systemic treatment regimens based on ORR and duration of response data from the pivotal SORAYA trial.\r\nLATE-BREAKING ORAL PRESENTATION\r\nTitle: Phase III MIRASOL (GOG 3045/ENGOT-ov55) Study: Initial Report of Mirvetuximab Soravtansine vs. Investigator's Choice of Chemotherapy in Platinum-Resistant, Advanced High-Grade Epithelial Ovarian, Primary Peritoneal, or Fallopian Tube Cancers with High Folate Receptor-Alpha Expression\r\nPresenter: Dr. Kathleen Moore, Associate Director of Clinical Research and Director of the Oklahoma TSET/Sarah Cannon Phase I Program, Professor of the Section of Gynecologic Oncology at The University of Oklahoma and MIRASOL Principal Investigator\r\nSession: Late-Breaking Abstract Session: Presentation and Discussion of LBA5507\r\nDate: Sunday, June 4, 2023\r\nTime: 7:30 am to 8:05 am CT / 8:30 am to 9:05 am ET\r\nPOSTER PRESENTATIONS\r\nImmunoGen is also presenting two trial-in-progress posters at ASCO.\r\nTitle: GLORIOSA: A Randomized, Open-Label, Phase 3 Study of Mirvetuximab Soravtansine with Bevacizumab vs. Bevacizumab as Maintenance in Platinum-Sensitive Ovarian, Fallopian Tube, or Primary Peritoneal Cancer\r\nPresenter: Dr. David O'Malley, Professor, Director of Gynecologic Oncology at the Ohio State University and the James Cancer Center\r\nAbstract: TPS5622\r\nPoster Board: 312a\r\nTitle: A Phase 1b/2 Study of Pivekimab Sunirine in Combination with Venetoclax/Azacitidine or Magrolimab for Patients with CD123-Positive Acute Myeloid Leukemia\r\nPresenter: Dr. Naval Daver, Associate Professor in the Department of Leukemia at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center\r\nAbstract: TPS7073\r\nPoster Board: 203a\r\nAdditional information can be found at www.asco.org.\r\nABOUT OVARIAN CANCER\r\nOvarian cancer is the leading cause of death from gynecological cancers in the US. Each year, roughly 20,000 patients are diagnosed, and 13,000 patients will die. Most patients present with late-stage disease and will typically undergo surgery followed by platinum-based chemotherapy. Unfortunately, the majority of patients eventually develop platinum-resistant disease, which is difficult to treat. In this setting, standard of care single-agent chemotherapies are associated with low response rates, short durations of response, and significant toxicities.\r\nABOUT ELAHERE\r\nELAHERE (mirvetuximab soravtansine-gynx) is a first-in-class ADC comprising a folate receptor alpha-binding antibody, cleavable linker, and the maytansinoid payload DM4, a potent tubulin inhibitor designed to kill the targeted cancer cells.\r\nIndication and Usage\r\nELAHERE\u00ae is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with folate receptor-alpha (FR\u03b1) positive, platinum-resistant epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer, who have received one to three prior systemic treatment regimens. Select patients for therapy based on an FDA-approved test.\r\nThis indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and durability of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.\r\nImportant Safety Information\r\nBOXED WARNING: OCULAR TOXICITY\r\n<ul><li>\r\nELAHERE can cause severe ocular toxicities, including visual impairment, keratopathy, dry eye, photophobia, eye pain, and uveitis.\r\n</li><li>\r\nConduct an ophthalmic exam including visual acuity and slit lamp exam prior to initiation of ELAHERE, every other cycle for the first 8 cycles, and as clinically indicated.\r\n</li><li>\r\nAdminister prophylactic artificial tears and ophthalmic topical steroids.\r\n</li><li>\r\nWithhold ELAHERE for ocular toxicities until improvement and resume at the same or reduced dose.\r\n</li><li>\r\nDiscontinue ELAHERE for Grade 4 ocular toxicities.\r\n</li></ul>WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS\r\nOcular Disorders\r\nELAHERE can cause severe ocular adverse reactions, including visual impairment, keratopathy (corneal disorders), dry eye, photophobia, eye pain, and uveitis.\r\nOcular adverse reactions occurred in 61% of patients with ovarian cancer treated with ELAHERE. Nine percent (9%) of patients experienced Grade 3 ocular adverse reactions, including visual impairment, keratopathy/keratitis (corneal disorders), dry eye, photophobia, and eye pain; and one patient (0.2%) experienced Grade 4 keratopathy. The most common (\u22655%) ocular adverse reactions were visual impairment (49%), keratopathy (36%), dry eye (26%), cataract (15%), photophobia (13%), and eye pain (12%).\r\nThe median time to onset for first ocular adverse reaction was 1.2 months (range: 0.03 to 12.9). Of the patients who experienced ocular events, 49% had complete resolution and 39% had partial improvement (defined as a decrease in severity by one or more grades from the worst grade) at last follow up. Ocular adverse reactions led to permanent discontinuation of ELAHERE in 0.6% of patients.\r\nPremedication and use of lubricating and ophthalmic topical steroids eye drops during treatment with ELAHERE are recommended. Advise patients to avoid use of contact lenses during treatment with ELAHERE unless directed by a healthcare provider.\r\nRefer patients to an eye care professional for an ophthalmic exam including visual acuity and slit lamp exam prior to treatment initiation, every other cycle for the first 8 cycles, and as clinically indicated. Promptly refer patients to an eye care professional for any new or worsening ocular signs and symptoms.\r\nMonitor for ocular toxicity and withhold, reduce, or permanently discontinue ELAHERE based on severity and persistence of ocular adverse reactions.\r\nPneumonitis\r\nSevere, life-threatening, or fatal interstitial lung disease, including pneumonitis, can occur in patients treated with ELAHERE. Pneumonitis occurred in 10% of patients treated with ELAHERE, including 0.8% with Grade 3 events, and 1 patient (0.2%) with a Grade 4 event. One patient (0.2%) died due to respiratory failure in the setting of pneumonitis and lung metastases.\r\nMonitor patients for pulmonary signs and symptoms of pneumonitis. Infectious, neoplastic, and other causes for symptoms should be excluded through appropriate investigations.\r\nWithhold ELAHERE for patients who develop persistent or recurrent Grade 2 pneumonitis until symptoms resolve to \u2264 Grade 1 and consider dose reduction. Permanently discontinue ELAHERE in all patients with Grade 3 or 4 pneumonitis. Patients who are asymptomatic may continue dosing of ELAHERE with close monitoring.\r\nPeripheral Neuropathy (PN)\r\nPN occurred in 36% of patients with ovarian cancer treated with ELAHERE across clinical trials; 2% of patients experienced Grade 3 PN. PN adverse reactions included peripheral neuropathy (19%), peripheral sensory neuropathy (9%), paraesthesia (6%), neurotoxicity (3%), hypoaesthesia (2%), peripheral motor neuropathy (1%), neuralgia (0.4%), polyneuropathy (0.2%) and oral hypoesthesia (0.2%).\r\nMonitor patients for signs and symptoms of neuropathy. For patients experiencing new or worsening PN, withhold dosage, dose reduce, or permanently discontinue ELAHERE based on the severity of PN.\r\nEmbryo-Fetal Toxicity\r\nBased on its mechanism of action, ELAHERE can cause embryo-fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman because it contains a genotoxic compound (DM4) and affects actively dividing cells.\r\nAdvise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ELAHERE and for 7 months after the last dose.\r\nADVERSE REACTIONS\r\nSerious adverse reactions occurred in 31% of patients. The most common (\u22652%) serious adverse reactions were intestinal obstruction (8%), ascites (4%), infection (3%), and pleural effusion (3%). Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 2% of patients, including small intestinal obstruction (1%) and pneumonitis (1%).\r\nPermanent discontinuation of ELAHERE due to adverse reactions occurred in 11% of patients. The most common (\u22652%) adverse reactions leading to permanent discontinuation were intestinal obstruction (2%) and thrombocytopenia (2%). One patient (0.9%) permanently discontinued ELAHERE due to visual impairment (unilateral decrease to BCVA &lt; 20/200 that resolved to baseline after discontinuation).\r\nDosage delays of ELAHERE due to an adverse reaction occurred in 39% of patients. Adverse reactions which required dosage delays in \u22653% of patients included visual impairment (15%), keratopathy (11%), neutropenia (6%), dry eye (5%), cataracts (3%) and increased gamma-glutamyltransferase (3%).\r\nDose reductions of ELAHERE due to an adverse reaction occurred in 20% of patients. Adverse reactions which required dose reductions in \u22653% of patients included visual impairment (9%) and keratopathy (7%).\r\nThe most common (\u226520%) adverse reactions, including laboratory abnormalities, were vision impairment, fatigue, increased aspartate aminotransferase, nausea, increased alanine aminotransferase, keratopathy, abdominal pain, decreased lymphocytes, peripheral neuropathy, diarrhea, decreased albumin, constipation, increased alkaline phosphatase, dry eye, decreased magnesium, decreased leukocytes, decreased neutrophils, and decreased hemoglobin.\r\nDRUG INTERACTIONS\r\nStrong CYP3A4 Inhibitors\r\nDM4 is a CYP3A4 substrate. Concomitant use of ELAHERE with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors may increase unconjugated DM4 exposure, which may increase the risk of ELAHERE adverse reactions. Closely monitor patients for adverse reactions with ELAHERE when used concomitantly with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors.\r\nUSE IN SPECIAL POPULATIONS\r\nLactation\r\nAdvise women not to breastfeed during treatment with ELAHERE and for at least 1 month after the last dose.\r\nPediatric Use\r\nSafety and effectiveness of ELAHERE have not been established in pediatric patients.\r\nHepatic Impairment\r\nAvoid use of ELAHERE in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment (total bilirubin &gt;1.5 ULN).\r\nPlease see full Prescribing Information, including Boxed Warning for ELAHERE.\r\nABOUT IMMUNOGEN\r\nImmunoGen is developing the next generation of antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) to improve outcomes for cancer patients.

That recommendation raises the question of what comes next for Congress. The solutions Altman proposed creating an AI regulatory agency and requiring licensing for companies are interesting. But what the other experts on the same panel suggested is at least as important: requiring transparency on training data and establishing clear frameworks for AI-related risks.\r\nAnother point left unsaid was that, given the economics of building large-scale AI models, the industry may be witnessing the emergence of a new type of tech monopoly.\r\nRead more\r\nAs a researcher who studies social media and artificial intelligence, I believe that Altmans suggestions have highlighted important issues but dont provide answers in and of themselves. Regulation would be helpful, but in what form? Licensing also makes sense, but for whom? And any effort to regulate the AI industry will need to account for the companies economic power and political sway.\r\nAn agency to regulate AI?\r\nLawmakers and policymakers across the world have already begun to address some of the issues raised in Altmans testimony. The European Unions AI Act is based on a risk model that assigns AI applications to three categories of risk: unacceptable, high risk, and low or minimal risk. This categorization recognizes that tools for social scoring by governments and automated tools for hiring pose different risks than those from the use of AI in spam filters, for example.\r\nThe U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology likewise has an AI risk management framework that was created with extensive input from multiple stakeholders, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the Federation of American Scientists, as well as other business and professional associations, technology companies and think tanks.\r\nFederal agencies such as the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the Federal Trade Commission have already issued guidelines on some of the risks inherent in AI. The Consumer Product Safety Commission and other agencies have a role to play as well.\r\nRather than create a new agency that runs the risk of becoming compromised by the technology industry its meant to regulate, Congress can support private and public adoption of the NIST risk management framework and pass bills such as the Algorithmic Accountability Act. That would have the effect of imposing accountability, much as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and other regulations transformed reporting requirements for companies. Congress can also adopt comprehensive laws around data privacy.\r\nRegulating AI should involve collaboration among academia, industry, policy experts and international agencies. Experts have likened this approach to international organizations such as the European Organization for Nuclear Research, known as CERN, and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The internet has been managed by nongovernmental bodies involving nonprofits, civil society, industry and policymakers, such as the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers and the World Telecommunication Standardization Assembly. Those examples provide models for industry and policymakers today.\r\nCognitive scientist and AI developer Gary Marcus explains the need to regulate AI.\r\nLicensing auditors, not companies\r\nThough OpenAIs Altman suggested that companies could be licensed to release artificial intelligence technologies to the public, he clarified that he was referring to artificial general intelligence, meaning potential future AI systems with humanlike intelligence that could pose a threat to humanity. That would be akin to companies being licensed to handle other potentially dangerous technologies, like nuclear power. But licensing could have a role to play well before such a futuristic scenario comes to pass.\r\nAlgorithmic auditing would require credentialing, standards of practice and extensive training. Requiring accountability is not just a matter of licensing individuals but also requires companywide standards and practices.\r\nExperts on AI fairness contend that issues of bias and fairness in AI cannot be addressed by technical methods alone but require more comprehensive risk mitigation practices such as adopting institutional review boards for AI. Institutional review boards in the medical field help uphold individual rights, for example.\r\nAcademic bodies and professional societies have likewise adopted standards for responsible use of AI, whether it is authorship standards for AI-generated text or standards for patient-mediated data sharing in medicine.\r\nStrengthening existing statutes on consumer safety, privacy and protection while introducing norms of algorithmic accountability would help demystify complex AI systems. Its also important to recognize that greater data accountability and transparency may impose new restrictions on organizations.\r\nScholars of data privacy and AI ethics have called for technological due process and frameworks to recognize harms of predictive processes. The widespread use of AI-enabled decision-making in such fields as employment, insurance and health care calls for licensing and audit requirements to ensure procedural fairness and privacy safeguards.\r\nRequiring such accountability provisions, though, demands a robust debate among AI developers, policymakers and those who are affected by broad deployment of AI. In the absence of strong algorithmic accountability practices, the danger is narrow audits that promote the appearance of compliance.\r\nAI monopolies?\r\nWhat was also missing in Altmans testimony is the extent of investment required to train large-scale AI models, whether it is GPT-4, which is one of the foundations of ChatGPT, or text-to-image generator Stable Diffusion. Only a handful of companies, such as Google, Meta, Amazon and Microsoft, are responsible for developing the worlds largest language models.\r\nGiven the lack of transparency in the training data used by these companies, AI ethics experts Timnit Gebru, Emily Bender and others have warned that large-scale adoption of such technologies without corresponding oversight risks amplifying machine bias at a societal scale.\r\nIt is also important to acknowledge that the training data for tools such as ChatGPT includes the intellectual labor of a host of people such as Wikipedia contributors, bloggers and authors of digitized books. The economic benefits from these tools, however, accrue only to the technology corporations.\r\nProving technology firms monopoly power can be difficult, as the Department of Justices antitrust case against Microsoft demonstrated. I believe that the most feasible regulatory options for Congress to address potential algorithmic harms from AI may be to strengthen disclosure requirements for AI firms and users of AI alike, to urge comprehensive adoption of AI risk assessment frameworks, and to require processes that safeguard individual data rights and privacy.\r\nWant to know more about AI, chatbots, and the future of machine learning?

        "full_text": "By Stephen MihmWhat to make of the spectacle of Sam Altman, the boyish face of all things AI, coming to Washington to beg for regulation? In his written testimony, Altman declared: OpenAI believes that regulation of AI is essential. Not only that, he offered to help policymakers get it done.\r\nIn response, our nations senators fell over themselves to hail Altman as a selfless techno-prophet, at one point going so far as to offer him the job as chief regulator over artificial intelligence. Instead, they should have been asking themselves why a powerful entrepreneur who currently dominates an industry would be so welcoming of regulation in the first place. (Spoiler: Its not just any regulation, but well get to that in a bit.)In the popular imagination and in so much political rhetoric, regulation of business is portrayed as a plot to clip capitalists wings. But history suggests thats not quite right. Powerful business interests have openly advocated for regulation in the past, much as Altman recently did. But then, as now, the motivation was more about the companies own profit and competitive advantage than it was about the greater good.Though state and local regulations have a long history, the first significant wave of federal regulation in the US took place in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The Progressive Era, as its commonly called, saw a coalition of middle-class reformers bring the freewheeling, corrupt capitalism of the Gilded Age under a new regulatory regime governing everything from the railroads to meatpackers.\r\nThis characterisation of the period, which hardened into conventional wisdom by the 1930s, would come into question in the postwar era, when several academics began questioning whether business was quite as hostile to regulation as everyone assumed. Skeptics ranks included the political scientists Marver Bernstein and Samuel Huntington, both of whom wrote influential studies suggesting that business had turned Progressive Era regulatory agencies toward their own ends.The historian Gabriel Kolko went one step further. In 1962, Kolko published his Triumph of Conservatism, which advanced the heretical claim that business leaders, and not the reformers, inspired the eras legislation regulating business. In fact, Kolko argued, regulatory movements were usually initiated by the dominant business to be regulated.Typical of Kolkos view was his account of the meatpacking industry. Previously, most historians had credited Upton Sinclairs stomach-churning novel The Jungle with opening the door to long-overdue regulation. In the process, disreputable slaughterhouse industry giants like Swift &amp; Co. were dragged kicking and screaming under the watchful eyes of federal regulators.Kolko, though, mocked the idea that Sinclair had brought the packers to their knees. In fact, he concluded that the biggest meatpackers were warm friends of regulation because only the biggest packers, not their smaller, less organized competitors, had the resources to comply with the new restrictions. Regulation was a way of restraining competition and protecting market share. Kolko observed that Swift and its fellow industry giants celebrated passage of the Meat Inspection Act of 1906 with advertisements declaring: It is a wise law. Its enforcement must be universal and uniform.\r\nIn this first book and in a more focused study titled Railroads and Regulation, published in 1970, Kolko offered a sweeping indictment of what he believed to be a na\u00efve, simplistic understanding of the relationship between government and business. Kolko argued that regulatory agencies overwhelmingly served the interests of big business, which adeptly used them to fix prices and restrain competition. Railroads, for example, worked with the Interstate Commerce Commission to mute competition, ensuring higher profits via stable freight rates. For other industries, incumbent firms embraced regulation as a way of rewarding their capital investments in cutting-edge technology. For example, the condiments king Henry J. Heinz and brewer Frederick Pabst benefited greatly when Congress passed food purity laws that enshrined their methods of manufacturing as the new standard, leaving smaller rivals at a distinct disadvantage.\r\nKolkos writings provoked intense debate in academic circles, with critics arguing that the story was inevitably more complicated. It didnt help, perhaps, that Kolko wore his leftist politics on his sleeve, infuriating more moderate historians. Ironically, he found the most hospitable reception among libertarian economists like George Stigler.\r\nIn 1971, Stigler published an article titled The Theory of Economic Regulation that provided a theoretical understanding for why regulation almost always ended up serving the interests of big business. This became known as the theory of regulatory capture, which held that large, incumbent firms typically used regulations to thwart competitors. The analysis went on to become one of the most-cited economics articles ever written, helping Stigler win the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences in 1982.\r\nNot that you would know any of this from watching Congress lap up Sam Altmans pleas for regulation of the blossoming AI industry. Instead, our senators swallowed the tech titans testimony with all the skepticism of a bunch of slack-jawed yokels listening to a carnival barker.\r\nThat Altman has singlehandedly steered what started out as an altruistic nonprofit venture into a for-profit corporation joined at the hip with industry behemoth Microsoft Corp. didnt seem to give the senators any pause. Nor did the fact that OpenAI and its ilk have arguably engaged in the greatest theft of intellectual property in human history to create their thinking machines. Instead, we were treated to the sad spectacle of Louisiana Republican Senator John Kennedy imploring Altman: Tell us what rules to implement.\r\nIt is instructive that a little over a week after Altmans plea for regulation, he threatened to exit the European Union after the trading bloc began drafting AI regulations that his company didnt get to dictate. Thats hardly surprising given that Europe doesnt have quite the same historical tradition of cozy relations between regulators and big business. The EU might, egad, actually put the public interest ahead of Altmans profit.\r\nThough Altman walked back his threat, its a harbinger of things to come. Congress needs to wake up and recognise that while AI may well be new and novel, the tech sectors pleas for regulation particularly those of an incumbent like OpenAI are straight out of a playbook written by the biggest businesses of the Gilded Age.\r\nDon\u2019t miss out on ET Prime stories!

O jogador deu lugar para Paulo Henrique e viu do banco de reservas a derrota para o Fortaleza, por 2 a 0, no \u00faltimo s\u00e1bado, mas volta a ser titular justamente contra o rival que teve a maior alegria desde que chegou ao Cruz-Maltino.\r\nFoi com o p\u00e9 direito de Puma Rodr\u00edguez que o Vasco venceu o Flamengo, por 1 a 0, na Ta\u00e7a Guanabara, vit\u00f3ria que deixou o Cruz-Maltino em boas condi\u00e7\u00f5es para se classificar para semifinal do Carioca.

        "title": "Radical New Honda CR-V Wasn't Built With Families in Mind",
        "file_name": "2023-06-04_62349772.txt",
        "full_text": "The Honda CR-V is about as normal a vehicle that anyone can imagine. It's a small crossover that offers all-wheel drive, a couple of four-cylinder engine options and a hybrid. Honda has sold millions of them. It sold 361,000 in 2021 and is on pace to break its record in 2023. The Honda CR-V Hybrid Racer, introduced earlier this year at the season-opening IndyCar race in Florida, is not the same vehicle.\r\nIt kinda looks like a CR-V if you squint. It has the new front end, captured on the redesign of the passenger car in 2022. The rear bodywork is actually the same. However, the rest of the prototype, rolling lab race car, is nothing like your granny's crossover.\r\nFor starters, it has an IndyCar engine, at least, a variation of the 2.2-liter, twin-turbo six-cylinder hybrid powerplant that will be in next year's race cars. That means around 800 horsepower, fed to the rear wheels only, under the tube-frame, race car-like chassis with a back end that opens like a clamshell. The hood is lightweight and removable, hiding an Acura NSX GT3 race car front suspension. The rear suspension is from a different Honda race car.\r\nThe Honda CR-V Hybrid Racer is what happens when you let engineers loose to create without rules or restrictions.\r\nThe Honda CR-V Hybrid Racer uses a modified IndyCar engine.Honda Motor Co., Ltd.\r\n\"David Salters, Honda Performance Development (HPD) president, he likes to have crazy dreams. And so he said 'why don't we put together an IndyCar engine with a hybrid system? And we'll kind of come up with this concept so they can use it to promote both IndyCar and the CR-V,'\" vice president of HPD Kelvin Fu told Newsweek.\r\n\"It's kind of a Frankenstein that kind of sits between the two of them. So we designed a custom tube frame chassis. We have the IndyCar engine in the back, but we also have this kind of unique hybrid system that was designed at HPD. It features supercapacitors that store energy and an Empel electric motor. So you'll start off on electric power and then it will fire up the engine. It's incredibly violent when that happens, so make sure you have your earplugs in,\" he said.\r\nAnd violent it was. The Hybrid Racer clanks and clunks as it waddles from a standstill on electric power, onto the 1.5-mile racetrack at M1 Concourse in Pontiac, Michigan, about 15 miles from the IndyCar race in downtown Detroit. Most race cars clunk and clang, but it will be covered by engine noise. Once on the track, the CR-V hybrid race engine fires up like an explosion, complete with smoky smells and vibrations all over the vehicle.\r\nAcceleration could be described as brutal, with facial skin (and internal organs) sliding rearward every time project lead and HPD factory driver James Nazarian punched the accelerator pedal. The massive brakes did the reverse, sending eyeball fluid (and internal organs) forward into the six-point racing harness and hard-shelled seat bolted onto the passenger side.\r\nEven with plugs the CR-V colloquially known as The Beast, was earsplitting, only quieting down as Nazarian entered the few tighter corners on the course. It's also hot. Unlike the street Honda CR-V, the Hybrid Racer does not have air conditioning. After two laps in full race gear including helmets, gloves and fireproof suits, it was sweaty enough in the cabin to take a break.\r\n\"We designed the frame and provided the powertrain, then we went to our racing team in (Marysville) Ohio. We started dropping stuff off there and they started putting it all together. So this is like a combination of all the racing that that Honda Performance Development does,\" said Fu.\r\nHonda will continue to use this CR-V Hybrid Racer rolling lab for experiments, including ones on the 100 percent renewable fuel it is using from Shell. This is how it improves both its racing and consumer cars.\r\n\"The same people we have doing ARX-06 GTP race car, which is a hybrid as well, took some of that learning and put it in the CR-V, and then some of that goes over to IndyCar. So it's a nice way that we can just experiment and have fun,\" David Salters, president of HPD told Newsweek.",

        "title": "The end of the Silicon Valley dream",
        "file_name": "2023-06-04_62349743.txt",
        "full_text": "It is difficult, given what Silicon Valley has become, to convey exactly what it was like in the 1970s and 80s. It was a remarkable centre of technology, but also the embodiment of the spirit of capitalism at its very best, as epitomised by garage start-ups like Apple. Greed, of course, is always a human motivation, but the early Valley culture was created by entrepreneurial outsiders who genuinely wanted to make the world better.\r\nIn the early days of the tech revolution, some watchers imagined an almost utopian, communitarian society on the horizon. In 1972, the California writer and zeitgeist diagnostician Stewart Brand predicted in\u00a0Rolling Stone\u00a0that when computers became widely available, we would all become Computer Bums, all more empowered as individuals and as co-operators. It would be a new era of enhanced spontaneous creation and of human interaction. The early digital idealists, tech guru Jaron Lanier recalled in 2014, envisioned a sharing web that functioned free from the constraints of the commercial order.\r\nI was there, working as West Coast editor for\u00a0Inc.\u00a0magazine (itself one of the premier media startups of the era). I remember those early Silicon Valley days as a period of extreme competition, with scores of companies battling to dominate emerging industries like laptop computers, disc drives and networking systems. One brilliant marketer and publicist, Regis McKenna, could offer a reporter scores of new companies to visit, mostly backed by venture capitalists. You could spend days interviewing remarkable people, all of whom seemed convinced theirs could be the next Hewlett Packard or Intel.\r\nOne of the firms Regis introduced me to was Silicon Valley Bank, whose founder Roger Smith epitomised the excited optimism of that time. Rogers enthusiasm was infectious and the assiduous way he worked the Valleys network of startups made him something of a local hero. As recently as a decade or so ago, even radicals saw the Silicon Valley crowd as an improvement on the old corporate elite. At the Occupy Wall Street protests in 2011, anti-capitalist demonstrators held moments of silence and prayer in memory of Steve Jobs, whom they seem not to have realised was a preternaturally ruthless capitalist. Some people still see Bill Gates, a clear monopolist, as, in the words of the left-wing French economist Thomas Piketty, one of the meritorious entrepreneurs. One progressive writer, David Callahan, portrays the tech oligarchs, along with their allies in the financial sector, as members of a sort of benign plutocracy in contrast to those past tycoons who built their fortunes on resource extraction, manufacturing and encouraging endless material consumption.\r\nThis distinction goes back to the ethos that defined the Valley in its early days. But very little remains of that founding culture. Americas tech titans have attained oligopolistic sway over markets comparable to that of John D. Rockefeller, Andrew Carnegie and Cornelius Vanderbilt. They may wear baseball caps rather than top hats, but their economic and cultural power is as vast and their rise has been the death knell of the Valleys bracing entrepreneurial culture.\r\nWe used to build the future. Then we designed it, now we just think about it\r\nThe collapse of Silicon Valley Bank is the latest indicator that the Valley site of nothing less than an economic miracle in recent decades is now in big trouble. Other signs include mass layoffs in the tech sector and a post-pandemic real estate downturn. The Valley, it seems, is entering a period of decadence that raises the prospect of long-term decline.\r\nThe start of this decline has coincided with a shift from the physical to the virtual. The Valleys roots were in the old engineer-driven economy, one connected to the rest of the country, and to working-class America somebody, its easy to forget, has to make the hardware. Today tech is dominated by a cognitive elite of Ivy Leaguers, management consultants and MBAs. We used to build the future, Leslie Parks, who formerly directed redevelopment efforts in San Jose, once told me. Then we designed it, now we just think about it.\r\nBut the Valley has slowly left the industrial battlefield it has lost over 160,000 manufacturing positions over the past two decades. It bought into the idea that the unique genius of its financial and corporate culture would be enough for it to thrive and profit as production headed first to Japan, then China and, more recently, to other parts of North America.\r\nThis is a familiar story. Consider, for example, how British industry lost its edge: the Industrial Revolution created a new class of tycoons; then the tycoons sons sought a return to the aristocratic past, eschewing dirty factories for elegant postings in the City or a relaxed life in their country estates. More recently, Detroits world-beating automotive industry squandered its technological and manufacturing advantages in a rush, pushed by Wall Street and its own financial managers, to earn easy profits from inferior products.\r\nTo be clear, the Valley is not done as a major tech centre. It still boasts a venture capital community, a remarkable concentration of engineering and other management talent, powerful universities and the headquarters of some of the biggest companies in the world. And it remains home to many of the tech giants that now exploit their monopolistic advantages. But that is not the same thing as being the place where the world looks for a vision of the future, as it once was. Even if the Valley still matters, it may no longer dominate the future as its denizens once assumed it would. Instead, it will face fierce competition for tech supremacy from other countries, and other parts of this one.\r\nThis reflects two different phenomena: rising competition from other regions and an internal rot that has infected the Valley. In its first few remarkable decades, the Valley was defined by its openness, its culture of competition and connection to the general economy. The people who built it, such as David Packard and Bill Hewlett, Fairchild Semiconductor co-founder Robert Noyce, and Apples Steve Jobs were, foremost, industrialists. They had a vision of how to use new technology to enhance productivity and make money.\r\nOver the last decade or two, the Valley has outsourced much of its industry. Apple produces two-fifths of its products in China, more than four times what is made in the United States. Other tech giants dont make anything. Rather than trying to build a better mousetrap, big tech now makes much of its billions off surveillance the source of the wealth generated by Google and Meta and by disintermediating retail businesses. It is a far cry from the optimistic promise of a better tomorrow on which the Valley was built.\r\nThree tech firms now account for two-thirds of all online advertising revenues, which now represent the vast majority of all ad sales, controlling in some cases upwards of 90 per cent of the market. Even in bad years, they can persist by laying off employees, relying on inertia to garner income without worry of competition in what the author David P. Goldman neatly summarises as the transformation of disruptive tech companies into rent-seeking monopolies.\r\nMany progressives persist in seeing the Golden State, and particularly Silicon Valley, as harbingers of a better, greener, more egalitarian future. In the words of two leading academics California Capitalism remains distinctive, a model of an environmentally friendly economy that epitomises fiscal responsibility, innovation as well as inclusive, sustainable, long-term growth.\r\nThis vision could not be further from reality. The stranglehold of mega-firms and the associated Wall Street and venture capital money machine has undermined competition in fields from video games to artificial intelligence to cloud services to the metaverse and AI. To be sure, theres some competition among the giants, much as there was between aristocratic clans in Europe or Japans feudal daimyo, but there are vanishingly diminished opportunities for the sort of startup that made up much of\u00a0Silicon Valley Banks\u00a0deposit base. Tech today is largely a game played between giants who, if they see promising technology, simply acquire it. Tech entrepreneur turned author Antonio Garc\u00eda Mart\u00ednez has called the contemporary Valley feudalism with better marketing, a highly stratified quasi-medieval society with little social mobility. With control of key markets, firms that columnist Michael Lind refers to as toll-booth companies can exact money from consumers who have little choice of going elsewhere a bit like feudal lords. And if these barons compete, it is against one another. Largely ignored has been the impact of these changes on the people who live in the Valley. In the Eighties and Nineties it was heralded as an exemplar of middle-class aspiration. No longer. And that, too, is thanks in part to deindustrialisation.\r\nThe kinds of tech jobs being created in the Valley produce opportunities only for a narrow subset of highly skilled, well-connected or credentialed employees. The Bay Area has been described as a region of segregated innovation. Lower- and even mid-level workers at firms such as Google sometimes sleep in their cars while others have been forced into mobile-home parks or even homeless encampments.\r\nAs the Valley has become more feudal, its political culture has become more uniformly progressive\r\nPerhaps nowhere is the social rot more evident than in San Francisco, arguably Americas premier high-tech city but now more associated with high crime rates, homelessness and disorder.\r\nOddly, as the Valley has become more feudal its reliance on indentured H-1B visa holders repeats a very old arrangement its political culture has become more uniformly progressive. Back in its heyday, the Valleys disproportionate number of eccentric and oddball engineers and tech visionaries belied a pragmatic political culture. It was a place where middle-of-the-road pragmatists in either party would be heard. In the Eighties and Nineties, Silicon Valley, like many industries, placed its bets on both political parties. Moderate Republicans, such as Pete McCloskey, Ed Zschau and Tom Campbell, and pro-business Democrats, such as Bill Clinton, all did well there.\r\nTodays Valley is a political monolith, with virtually no elected Republicans. Almost all 2016 and 2018 contributions from Silicon Valley tech owners and employees went to Democrats. Tech money helped Governor Gavin Newsom outspend his GOP rival three to one with major contributions from former Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer and Laurene Jobs (widow of the Apple founder) at the top of the donor list. Techs successful seduction of the DC establishment was first evident in the Obama years, and they repaid their allies by censoring information during the 2020 campaign, with increasingly politicised algorithms monitoring online language to the ultimate benefit of one party.\r\nNow the Valley could be called the epicentre of the gentry progressive universe. In 2020 former Google chairman Eric Schmidt headed data efforts for several Democratic presidential candidates, including Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, Cory Booker and Elizabeth Warren. Five of the top eight Biden donors in that cycle came from tech firms. Also in 2020, the Chan-Zuckerberg initiative committed $300 million to boosting progressive-voter turnout.\r\nTheres some notion that this single-mindedness may have contributed to recent Valley disasters. SVBs board was packed with Hillary Clinton, Biden and Obama backers. The bank invested in nonprofits linked to Governor Gavin Newsom, and serviced left-wing media such as\u00a0Vox\u00a0and the troubled progressive site\u00a0BuzzFeed. Some on the right have been happy to tie the banks decline to its inordinate attention to such non-banking concerns as climate change, racial justice and other progressive causes. This point may be exaggerated, but certainly the board did not seem to focus on the basics. The bank may also have expected gentle handling from the San Francisco Federal Reserve, which has also been focused on the adoption of progressive policies, and which seems to have dozed as the company moved towards bankruptcy.\r\nIt might not have been so odd for SVB to expect the fairly gentle handling it ended up getting: in recent years, the tech industry as a whole has developed one of the most powerful lobbies in Washington, cultivating supporters both on the right and left. A decade ago, Joe Green, a former roommate of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and head of the Valley lobbying group FWD.us, suggested in a leaked memo that people in tech can become one of the most powerful political forces in the country since they increasingly control what he labeled the avenues of distribution. He was right. Once known as quirky outsiders, the Valley is now the establishment. They even recently dragooned former defense and intelligence officials into signing a letter arguing that these companies are essentially national treasures and should not be subject to antitrust or other regulatory curbs. Some of this would be more understandable if big tech embraced the idea of national interest.\r\nYet despite all the money and power, fewer and fewer people, in or out of politics, share this enthusiasm for these national treasures. Today the vast majority of Americans are inclined to fear the tech elite, and the industrys approval dropped dramatically even before the pandemic. Todays Valley is a far cry from the life-improving, concrete promise of twentieth-century industrial achievement. People see that techs giants reap fortunes from ever greater surveillance and socially destructive social media; techs contributions to well-being and economic prosperity are far more difficult to keep front of mind.\r\nAnd as competition declines, the incentive to manipulate information, and boost profits through surveillance, seems to be irresistible. This is far more pervasive in terms of political and cultural life than, say, the power of the Big Three in Detroits heyday. Henry Ford may have been an awful human being, but he couldnt have surveilled his employees, much less his customers, like Google or Meta. Nor did the titans of the auto age seek dominion in fields as diverse as healthcare, space travel, entertainment and, of course, cars themselves.\r\nTodays tech giants are more akin to high-tech\u00a0zaibatsu, the almighty Japanese conglomerates, than the heroic good guys of lets put on a show! tech innovation. Their leaders have become middle-aged tycoons whove created a modern version of Middle Ages feudalism, and theyre unsurprisingly facing something of a peasants rebellion. A socialist movement is even percolating among tech employees, many of whom see little opportunity to amass enough wealth just to buy a house in the exorbitant Bay Area. In 2021 Knock.com estimated that, at current prices, households with median income would need more than a century to save for a down payment on the median-priced new home in San Jose, San Francisco or Los Angeles.\r\nThe degree to which the Biden administration and federal economic entities seem compelled to protect the richest moguls and the largest companies have become very troubling indeed.\r\nThe Treasurys response to the SVB and other bank crises is built on the need to protect the venture capital industry, suggesting its strategic value in the economy as justification for bailing out billionaires and their investments. The middle- and working-class pay to bail out giant depositors, either directly or by higher insurance fees, while the big financial institutions will now step in and pick the strongest remaining candidates out of SVBs leftovers, further consolidating their hold on Americas once widely dispersed financial system.\r\nTo stand up against such wealth and power will require a melding of the two populist movements: the right-wing nationalists and the traditional, pro-worker left. By their often excessive public consumption private planes, giant yachts, bespoke space travel the present-day oligarch-barons look like minor feudal lords, and their incessant virtue-signaling comes across as a high-tech version of sumptuary laws: Space flight for me and not for thee.\r\nDoes all this suggest the Valley is finished? Not quite. Inertia is a mighty force. But something essential to the areas success has been lost and with it the Valleys hegemony over technology. The kingdoms spell has been broken, no doubt accelerated by the SVB collapse. The Valley may be a critical tech center for the foreseeable future, but it will no longer be\u00a0the\u00a0undisputed tech center.\r\nIf Silicon Valleys decline is exaggerated by some, and its demise prematurely proclaimed, notably in the conservative press and among Easterners who generally disdain California for its many successes, the process is undeniable and steady. And unless there is a significant change in the political direction of the state of California, a long-term and inexorable hollowing out of the Valley seems inevitable. Something unique, and miraculous, will be lost into the mists of history and legend.\r\nThis article was originally published in\u00a0The Spectators May 2023 World edition.\u00a0\r\nJoel Kotkin is the presidential fellow in Urban Futures at Chapman University and executive director of the Urban Reform Institute.

        "title": "I Was Canceled for Talking About Right-Wing Cancel Culture",
        "file_name": "2023-06-04_62349808.txt",
        "full_text": "For the first time in my life, I was canceled during a corporate keynote speech for talking about right-wing cancel culture.\r\nEarlier in the week, a tech companys Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) team invited me to address their employees to celebrate Asian American Pacific Islander Heritage Month, which ended in May. I lasted all of five and a half minutes before the Zoom meeting abruptly ended without a warning or any follow-up messages, texts, or calls from company personnel. \r\nI assumed it was a technical glitch. I spent 15 minutes trying to log back on but to no avail. After an hour and two emails, a member from the DEI committee finally replied and told me they ended the Zoom due to internal issues. That was the first and last communication I received. They initially didnt even inform their employees, several of whom messaged me on Twitter over the next two days asking if I was censored for my comments.\r\nSurely, I must have said something dangerous and outrageous.\r\nI must have used those six minutes to spread baseless conspiracies about election fraud, QAnon, and George Soros. Or, I probably mocked sexual assault survivors, referred to violent insurrectionists as great people, or defended dining with white nationalist leaders. No corporation, or self-respecting company, would ever platform individuals who espouse such hateful, divisive rhetoricright?\r\nIf I engaged in such behavior, most people would support and applaud this company for cutting off my mic. Or, maybe they canceled my speech due to my politics. I most likely named and shamed MAGA and thus alienated conservative employees. (Businesses have historically been neutral and complicit in the face of rising fascism, because, after all, both sides buy sneakers, so its not worth the potential financial risk to take a side in the face of a radicalized and weaponized movement that is attacking our freedoms and democracy.)\r\nNope. I did none of the above. I didnt even mention the words conservative, Republican, Trump, DeSantis, GOP, or MAGA. I simply made the mistake of telling my truth.\r\nI began my speech by sharing some lovely, helpful recommendations Ive received since the 9-11 terror attacks. They include emails that demand I go back to where I came from, to which I respond, The Bay Area? Id love to if you could subsidize my rent. I followed it up with another gem: folks telling me to go f****a goat. Its always goats and camels for some reason. Why only those two animals? Theres an entire animal kingdom, people! Be creative! I respond by thanking them for their suggestion but lament that I am now a 42-year-old man married to one woman and no longer have the physical dexterity to engage in bold sexual experimentation. However, I invite them to go f*** a goat or a camel and report back.\r\nThese are two examples I use to highlight the exciting adventures of being a Muslim American son of Pakistani immigrants in this heightened moment that Black folks have been experiencing for over 400 years. Were living in a country where some parents are more comfortable with their kids getting shot at school than reading a book written by a Black woman, I continued. In this moment, we cant say gay in some places that rhyme with Mlorida because saying gay makes some people uncomfortable. \r\nHow do you get to reconciliation without truth? You cant. You dont. You wont.\r\nAnd despite some peoples discomfort, I reminded the audience that transgender kids are still being bullied, harassed, and killed; Black people are still being shot and killed by the police; Asian Americans are still being blamed for COVID, because bigots, in addition to being cruel, are also dumb and think a virus that has killed over 1 million Americans has an ethnicity; and women have still lost a Constitutionally protected right to have autonomy over their bodies.\r\nAfter saying all this, I asked: How do you get to reconciliation without truth? You cant. You dont. You wont.\r\nThe company had a different response. They ended the Zoom meeting.\r\nIn hindsight, the timing was utterly exquisite and couldnt have been scripted better. They canceled me, their Asian American speaker, right as I was talking about our stories being banned and our communities being marginalized to placate the economic anxiety of a few. \r\nAccording to employees who messaged me, the company initially told them the meeting ended due to technical difficulties. I posted a Twitter thread of my unfortunate experience, which then forced them to admit they had maybe been too hasty in pulling the plug for fear of offending some people. They did, however, find time to send a stern message to my speaking agency asking me to delete my tweets. I refused.\r\nIm still debating whether I should be upset or proudly wear it as a badge of honor considering diversity initiatives, stories written by people of color, and corporations are being targeted and attacked by right-wing extremists across America because they reject white, Christian theocracy in favor of a multiracial democracy.\r\nI have been anointed to a growing rogues gallery of alleged woke radicals funded by Jewish American billionaire George Soros to replace real Americans. These are often, but not exclusively, conservative GOP voters who are suffering from immense economic anxiety due to women and people of color having the audacity to demand equity, respect, and dignity. These people fear that homosexuality works through osmosis and magic: if their son simply hears the word gay or reads a book that features gay people then he will immediately start kissing boys, change his pronouns, wear a dress, and take drag lessons from George Santos.\r\nI shared my story to invite the company, which I havent named, to do better if it wants to retain and recruit employees of color who will no longer tolerate performative DEI bullshit and minority tokenism. Our lives and stories arent a game of taboo where we wont say scary words like white supremacy, privilege, and systemic racism, just because it causes some short-term discomfort and agitation for a few people. \r\nImagine the discomfort we feel when Trump tells us to go back and promises bans against our people. My story is also a microcosm of what will happen in America if corporations continue to pre-emptively bend the knee to placate a radicalized minority that will gladly embrace fascism to feel great again. Their bellies, and their rage, will only continue to grow.\r\nYou dont win over fascists with compliments and a curtsey. If you choose to bend the knee, then you might as well hand over your neck.\r\nIf you dont believe me, just look at whats happening with Chick-fil-A. Just in time for Pride month, the successful fast food chain, which is closed on Sundays for religious reasons, has allegedly joined the woke parade. Even though Chick-fil-A has long been a champion of right-wing, homophobic policies, they now face boycotts because conservative activists have spread misinformation about the companys DEI officer. \r\nTheyre also outraged that their corporate policy focuses on ensuring equal access and creating a culture of belonging, which is, literally, the lowest bar on Earth for a corporate franchise with nearly three thousand restaurants in 47 states that both employs and serves the entire racial, religious, sexual and political spectrum of America. However, equal access and a culture of belonging is too extreme for MAGA, which is deploying zealous activists flush with right-wing money and GOP political support to defund libraries and threaten educators.\r\nMAGA and right-wing anti-LGBTQ activists, which belong to the same Venn Diagram, are trying to pressure and threaten companies like Chick-fil-A to abandon their meager and performative attempts at diversity. Theyre proudly holding up the scalps of Target and Anheuser-Bush InBev, two companies theyve targeted with manufactured outrage and boycotts for simply acknowledging and catering to LGBTQ+ people, who actually exist and can be named out loud unlike Voldemort.\r\nYou dont win over fascists with compliments and a curtsey. If you choose to bend the knee, then you might as well hand over your neck. The only way forward is for the majority, including companies, to realize we have the numbers and thus we have the power to fight back and win. \r\nAfter being attacked and punished by DeSantis, Disney, the biggest employer in Florida, has responded by pulling its proposed $1 billion office complex in Florida that would have created more than 2,000 high-paying jobs. Teachers are uniting with parents in red districts and successfully defeating right-wing activists who are trying to take over school boards, defund libraries, and spread hateful lies about CRT.\r\nJudging by Trumps vindictiveness and betrayals alone, it should be clear to anyone whos been paying attention that MAGA will turn on anyone, even its most loyal acolytes. This is the same group whose members were perfectly willing to hunt down and kill Vice President Pence, the most white, conservative, Republican man on Earth, simply because he didnt go along with the insurrection. Earlier this week, Trump slammed his former press secretary, Kayleigh McEnany, who is the most white, conservative, Republican woman on Earth. If theyre willing to go after them and Chick-Fil-A, what hope do you have?\r\nAs far as my uncomfortable speaking engagement, I made sure the company still paid me. This counts as the most lucrative dollar-for-minute speaking engagement of my career. I, for one, shall keep speaking. Ill continue telling my truth. I still have a lot to say. Six minutes isnt enough. After all, I also have a big appetite. Ill keep opening my mouth, and Ill keep eating.",

Example of a gender diversity dashboard for a manager.\r\nThese are examples of outcomes achieved by our customers with the visibility provided:\r\n<ul><li>Increased engagement: Minority and female engagement increased</li><li>Increase in minorities at VP and above levels: Over 50% over the last five years</li><li>Increase in women at SVP+ levels: Critical mass reached 40%</li></ul>With SAP SuccessFactors Workforce Analytics, organizations can analyze diversity and inclusion across all HR and talent processes, including recruiting, performance, compensation, learning, promotion, transfers, leadership and succession planning, by any of the dimensions described here (or extended to include new dimensions as required by customer). This makes the solution extremely powerful in ferreting out workplace inequity.\r\nGetting started\r\nWith the depth and breadth of metrics coverage provided, SAP makes it simple for organizations to analyze for inequity. The more significant challenge is that organizations must want to look for inequity in the first place. If they find something, they cannot just ignore it. They must be prepared to do something about it. Is your organization culturally and politically ready to take on the diversity and inclusion challenge brought to light from these analytics?
