        "full_text": "(Bloomberg) -- When Dan Vahdat set out to build a healthcare startup, the UK was an ideal launchpad. That was 2011 and the nations deep network of medical research centers and vast National Health Service patient data sets helped him expand the software platform, Huma Therapeutics, into a $1 billion company. For the next billion dollars he is looking elsewhere.\r\nMost Read from Bloomberg\r\nHuma, which helps doctors monitor and analyze patient data, cuts across several sectors that the UK government vowed to prioritize after leaving the European Union three years ago. But instead of creating opportunities, Brexit and the political chaos that came with it have fostered an environment that businesses say is increasingly difficult to work with.\r\nVahdats options include moving investment to Germany or France, where President Emmanuel Macrons team has reached out to him every few months to discuss business opportunities. The Huma founder is eyeing an eventual listing in New York, with its deeper pools of capital.\r\nWe havent seen any progress in the UK for three or four years, Vahdat said. The hope was that with Brexit something should have changed, because the whole idea was that we were going to have more autonomy. But nothing has happened.\r\nVahdats comments would be easy to dismiss if he was an outlier. But they follow an outpouring of complaints from leaders of some of the worlds best-known companies about the declining investment appeal of the worlds sixth-largest economy. Taken together, they paint a picture of a country adrift at a time when the $370 billion green subsidy program in the US has kicked off an economic arms race.\r\nThe FTSE 100 is up just 1.5% this year lagging behind other indexes in the US and Europe. And investors do not appear convinced that UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunaks plans will be enough to jumpstart growth, creating an opportunity for the opposition Labour Party leader Keir Starmer ahead of an election expected next year. His pitch to big business includes an ambition to borrow up to \u00a328 billion a year to accelerate Britains green transition by building wind farms, insulating homes, delivering new nuclear capacity and developing nascent green industries.\r\nUS pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly &amp; Co. cited a stifling commercial environment that doesnt invite investment while suspending UK expansion plans in May. Brad Smith, the president of Microsoft Corp., said the UKs decision to block its acquisition of Activision Blizzard Inc. showed the EU was better for business. James Dyson, the Brexit supporting founder of the eponymous maker of high-end vacuums and fans, has recently accused the government of scandalous neglect of the science sector.\r\nCovid-19 vaccine producer AstraZeneca Plc and carmaker Stellantis NV have blamed government policies for forcing them to look abroad for factory sites. In one particularly stinging blow in March, home-grown chip-designer Arm Ltd. chose New York over London for what is likely to be the biggest initial public offering of the year. And last week a group of almost 1,000 tech companies including Alphabet Inc. and Apple Inc. warned the UK is falling behind in sectors like AI and semiconductors.\r\nThe frustrations extend beyond the high tech sector.\r\nThe government needs to show that it is listening to not just one area of business, said Martha Lane Fox, President of the British Chambers of Commerce and a tech entrepreneur, but the whole country, and really responding to the needs of businesses across multiple different sectors.\r\nExtraordinarily Bureaucratic\r\nBusiness leaders say the government has failed to set out a strategy on a scale necessary both to overcome loss of access to the European single market and contest the economic arms race kick-started by the Inflation Reduction Act in the US last year. Complaints about the UK are centered around the high tax burden, out-of-date regulations and lack of government support. The health service needs rescuing, regulations need trimming and updating, tax incentives need focus, the executives say.\r\nWe are an extraordinarily bureaucratic country, Guy Hands, the chairman of private equity firm Terra Firma told Bloomberg TV in May. The EU got blamed for bureaucracy. The reality is, weve left the EU and weve lost none of that bureaucracy. If anything, weve actually increased it.\r\nPolitical turmoil has not helped. Inaction and uncertainty have been hallmarks of policy since Britons voted to leave the EU, as five prime ministers cycled through Downing Streets black door, including former Prime Minister Boris Johnson who in 2018 made the infamous proclamation f**k business.\r\nBusiness leaders credit Sunak with restoring stability and concede that, barring access to the EU single market, the UK retains the advantages that made it Europes favorite investment destination: top universities and schools, English law, the English language, London and a flexible workforce. The country may lag France on new projects but has shifted to a value over volume strategy. On that measure its far ahead in terms of jobs created per project and R&amp;D intensity, according to the EY Attractiveness Survey. Despite the economic downturn and political instability in Westminster, Britain still secured 26% of all European financial services foreign direct investment projects in 2022.\r\nIt is really easy to see the areas that could be successful in the UK in the next 10 to 20 years, Lloyds Banking Group Chief Executive Charlie Nunn told Bloomberg on May 30. The transition to net zero, energy, housing and infrastructure. There is massive demand for investment in these areas, but we need a strong framework and policies to make it possible to create a market and finance these projects.\r\nPlanning is a persistent issue. It takes five years to get approval to build a wind farm according to trade body RenewableUK, and then the electricity grid may not even have capacity to take the power. Reforms to speed up house building were watered down last year, exacerbating a housing shortfall that some estimates place in the millions. In healthcare, a 41% collapse between 2017 and 2021 in the number of clinical trials initiated in the UK threatens innovation in the life sciences industry.\r\nThe broader regulatory backdrop is no better. Business leaders say the pendulum has swung so far to consumer protection that its suffocating growth. The government has been battling financial regulators to relax banking rules to increase risk-taking. Tech lobbyists warn that, while giants like Microsoft will inevitably have their wings clipped, blocking tie-ups among smaller players like the tech investment companies Seedrs Ltd and Crowdcube Ltd will only encourage founders to leave the UK.\r\nRead more: The Labour Party Is Winning the Business Vote\r\nChancellor Jeremy Hunts budget in March was another disappointment to many business leaders. Corporation tax was raised from 19% to 25% accompanied by a generous three-year 100% relief on capital spending that was supposed to help close the investment gap with Germany and France. But the governments own forecasting body has said that the incentives time limit means it will do nothing for long-term growth.\r\nI dont care whether its a growth strategy or competitiveness, theres got to be a profound point of view as to how Britain is going to compete, said Archie Norman, chairman of retailer Marks &amp; Spencer and a former Tory MP. A competitive economy is one where the public and private sector work together on regulation, on trade, on investment in skills, on how government supports entrepreneurs, how we shape the tax system. At the moment thats come slightly adrift post-Brexit.\r\nThe governments apparent lack of ambition can be seen in its response to the US green plan, which it initially dismissed as dangerous. Thats a seismic act of competitive strategy. And we cant say, oh, we don't do that. You cant sit out of it, Norman added.\r\nAnnouncements this year, including a \u00a31 billion ($1.2 billion) pledge for semiconductor research, a possible \u00a3500 million loan guarantee for carmaker Jaguar Land Rover to build a giga factory and a package of rehashed green energy plans were dwarfed by the tens of billions of dollars being promised by the US and Europe.\r\nThe UK also starts the new global race with a handicap. The British economy has been the slowest to recover from Covid of all Group of Seven nations and is the only one with a smaller workforce than before the pandemic. The tax burden is the biggest since the Second World War, yet public services remain desperately underfunded, and inflation at 8.7% is among the highest in the developed world. That persistent inflation means UK government bonds are among the worst-performing across major developed economies this year. The yield on 10-year securities has climbed more than 120 basis points from a low in February to over 4.20% last week levels seen during last year's gilt crisis.\r\nThe US has changed the rules of engagement, said Raoul Ruparel, a former special adviser to ex-Prime Minister Theresa May whos now director of Boston Consulting Groups Centre for Growth. It doesnt feel like we are leveling the kind of response needed.\r\nWake Up\r\nThe backlash from business leaders is a measure of how far the Conservative Partys reputation has fallen. Between 2010 and 2016, the UK was Europes undisputed capital for FDI, with David Camerons government providing Home Office hotlines to ensure visa applications were fast-tracked, rolling out the Royal family to burnish egos, and cutting corporation and entrepreneur taxes.\r\nIn France, Macron took the lessons to heart, establishing a generous tax regime for talented foreign workers and holding lavish gatherings for bosses in the Palace of Versailles. By 2019, the cost of the damage to the UK was clear. France overtook Britain in new FDI projects for the first time in 20 years, according to the EY survey. FDI to the UK as a share of gross domestic product plunged to 0.5% in 2022, down from 1.3% in 2015, according to the OECD. It also slipped in France, from 1.9% in 2015 to 1.5% in 2022, but remains strong.\r\nFor the Labour Party, which has a double-digit lead in public opinion polls and secured big gains at Sunaks expense during local elections in May, the criticisms are a gift. Starmer has been winning over business support in a campaign similar to former Prime Minister Tony Blairs prawn cocktail offensive before his election win in 1997.\r\nWake up, Starmer chided Sunak in the House of Commons last month, accusing him of being content with managed decline. Its not the 1980s any more. A race is on. We need to be in it.\r\nRachel Reeves, Starmers pick for chancellor of the exchequer if Labour wins the next election, has promised a more interventionist approach from government, targeting growth in key industries such as life sciences. Shes also pledged to set up a business tax roadmap to give companies clarity beyond the lifetime of a single parliament.\r\nIn an effort to counter the narrative, Sunak hosted scores of UK-based business leaders at an event in April in which he paced across the stage like a Silicon Valley executive. This government is unashamedly pro-business, the prime minister said, arguing the UK was pretty much the most attractive place to invest anywhere in the world.\r\nThings quickly went wrong. Gerry Murphy, the chairman of Britains biggest luxury fashion firm Burberry Group Plc, questioned Sunaks perverse decision as chancellor to scrap VAT-free shopping for tourists, making the UK the least attractive shopping destination in Europe.\r\nIt may not have been the most auspicious start but at least Sunak was trying to repair relations. Howard Davies, chair of NatWest, expressed some sympathy for Sunak and Hunt. Their inheritance was very unattractive, he said. Even Burberrys Murphy said that the current government is obviously more business friendly than some previous administrations.\r\nSunak is also championing the digital, life sciences and green industries to create the Silicon Valleys of the 21st century but has committed precious little money. Hes hoping to release private capital for growth investment through a series of pension reforms but Richard Buxton, veteran fund manager at Jupiter Asset Management, fears the government lacks the courage to make the legislative changes needed.\r\nVahdat, the healthcare software entrepreneur, says that under previous UK governments he was in regular contact with civil servants and ministers, including being invited to attend a trade delegation to China in 2018. Now, he says, whenever he approaches contacts in government and other departments, he gets the impression they are too busy to process his queries and suggestions.\r\nFrance has been very, very persuasive with tax benefits, really trying to open doors and opportunities. Same goes in the US as well, he said. In the UK, no one offers anything. If anything, theyre taking things away.\r\n--With assistance from Andrew Atkinson, Stephanie Davidson and Simon Kennedy.\r\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\r\n\u00a92023 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "full_text": "Over the past two years, solar manufacturers have been hampered by supply chain disruptions including increasing material costs for polysilicon. Indeed, last year, Rystad Energy estimated that rising equipment and shipping costs could lead to\u00a0postponement or cancellation\u00a0of 56% of worldwide utility-scale solar projects that had been planned for 2022.\r\nLuckily, these challenges have been rapidly fading away. Energy prices have\u00a0fallen back to pre-war levels, driven lower by fears of a global recession and weak oil demand in China due to Covid outbreaks. The same scenario is unraveling in the solar sector, with Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF) reporting that costs of solar materials have\u00a0dropped by more than a third\u00a0since mid-November. The prices of wafers have fallen even more sharply, with wafer costs falling as much as 21 percent this week alone.\r\nEven better, serious money is flowing into the solar sector.\r\nThe amount of capital investment flowing into the solar sector is poised to overtake the amount of investment going into oil production for the first time ever in 2023, the International Energy Association\u00a0has reported.\r\nAccording to Fatih Birol, the IEA\u2019s executive director, solar investments are expected to attract over $1 billion a day in 2023 with over $1.7 trillion slated to flow clean energy technologies such as EVs, renewables and storage. Overall, global investment in energy is projected to hit ~$2.8 trillion in the current year.\r\nSpeaking to CNBC\u2019s Arabile Gumede on Thursday, Birol said there was a \u201cgrowing gap between the investment in fossil energy and investment [in] clean energy. Clean energy is moving fast--faster than many people realize. This is clear in the investment trends, where clean technologies are pulling away from fossil fuels. For every dollar invested in fossil fuels, about 1.7 dollars are now going into clean energy.\u201d\r\nSince the energy crisis hit two years ago, many of the world\u2019s governments have doubled down on renewable energy since they view the sector as an ideal way to not only decarbonize but also achieve energy security. Further, several oil producing hubs including Saudi Arabia and UAE are investing heavily in renewable energy as they try to diversify their economies.\r\nHere are 5 solar stocks for long-term investors.\r\nFirst Solar\r\nMarket Cap: $21.0B\r\n12-Month Returns: 165.8%\r\nFirst Solar Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:FSLR) is the largest U.S.-based developer of solar panels, with a focus on utility-scale panels.

FSLR expects to reach ~7GW nameplate capacity in the US by YE2023 and ~10GW by YE2025. Assuming FSLR qualifies for the $0.17/w credits, we estimate that these credits account for ~60% of FSLR\u2019s ASP, and the 10GW capacity would imply an after-tax benefit of ~$1.4bn/year.\u201d\r\nLast year, First Solar announced that it will build a new solar panel manufacturing facility in the Southeast of the U.S. In November, the company\u00a0picked Lawrence County in Alabama\u00a0as the location of its $1.1B factory. The company also plans to spend $185 million upgrading and expanding its existing facilities in Ohio. The announcement came hot on the heels of the passing of the IRA Act, underpinning the impact it\u2019s likely to have on First Solar\u2019s business.\r\nHowever, not every Wall Street analyst is bullish on FSLR especially over the short-term, with JPMorgan saying the easy money has likely been made while GLJ Research has downgraded the stock from a Buy to a Sell.\r\nEnphase Energy\r\nMarket Cap: $25.0B\r\n12-Month Returns: -13.1%\r\nEnphase Energy Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ: ENPH) is a leading designer and manufacturer of solar inverters, a critical hardware used in all solar energy installations.

Even more remarkable is that Enphase is not only solidly profitable, but also owns one of the biggest profit margins amongst the leading solar names with a gross margin north of 40%. Its nearest rival in this regard is\u00a0SolarEdge Technologies\u00a0(NASDAQ: SEDG) with GM of 29%. Interestingly, SolarEdge is one of the solar stocks that have recently\u00a0received an upgrade: back in December, Cowen reiterated its Outperform rating on SEDG and hiked its price target to $360 from $309, with analyst Jeffrey Osborne writing that SEDG is \"well positioned to benefit from secular solar demand driven by policy and higher electricity rates.\"\r\nRegarding IRA\u2019s effects on Enphase,\u00a0 analyst Brian Lee notes that it is potentially a \u201cdirect and near-term beneficiary of manufacturing credits\u201d.\r\n\u201cAssuming ENPH were to establish US capacity, ENPH would be eligible to capture the full amount of these credits, according to management. In addition, we believe ENPH is well positioned to benefit from the extension of the solar ITC which we believe will be supportive of a more stable demand environment for both residential and commercial solar and storage installations in the\u00a0US,\u201d according to the analyst.\r\nArray Technologies\r\nMarket Cap: $3.4B\r\n12-Month Returns: 69.2%\r\nAlbuquerque, New Mexico-based\u00a0Array Technologies\u00a0(NASDAQ: ARRY) designs and manufactures solar ground monitoring systems.

According to ROTH Capital\u2019s managing director Philip Shen, the UFLPA release is a big boon for JinkoSolar as it removes a huge policy risk that JKS faced. Under the UFLPA, the burden of proof demonstrating that goods imported from China's Xinjiang region were not\u00a0 manufactured with slave labor falls on the buyer. Companies are required to provide a complete list of all employees at their facilities, a detailed distribution network chart and enough evidence proving that laborers were not subjected to forced labor conditions.

        "full_text": "SAN DIEGO, June 11, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Robbins Geller Rudman &amp; Dowd LLP announces that purchasers or acquirers of Funko, Inc. (NASDAQ: FNKO) common stock on a U.S. open market between May 6, 2022 and March 1, 2023, both dates inclusive (the Class Period) have until August 1, 2023 to seek appointment as lead plaintiff of the Funko class action lawsuit. Captioned Studen v. Funko, Inc., No. 23-cv-00824 (W.D. Wash.), the Funko class action lawsuit charges Funko as well as certain of its current and former top executives with violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\r\nIf you suffered substantial losses and wish to serve as lead plaintiff of the Funko class action lawsuit, please provide your information here: \r\nhttps://www.rgrdlaw.com/cases-funko-inc-class-action-lawsuit-fnko.html\r\nYou can also contact attorney J.C. Sanchez of Robbins Geller by calling 800/449-4900 or via e-mail at jsanchez@rgrdlaw.com. \r\nCASE ALLEGATIONS: Funko is a pop culture consumer products company that creates vinyl figures, action toys, plush accessories, apparel, and homewares relating to movies, TV shows, video games, musicians, and sports teams. During the Class Period, Funko promoted both the planned move of Funkos distribution center from Everett, Washington to Buckeye, Arizona as well as the planned upgrade of Funkos enterprise resource planning (ERP) software system.\r\nThe Funko class action lawsuit alleges that defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) Funko was experiencing significantly larger delays in implementing its ERP software than it was disclosing to investors; (ii) having moved into a new warehouse without functioning ERP software in place would lead to dramatically higher costs and poorer inventory management practices; and (iii) Funkos inability to efficiently operate the new distribution center would have a substantial, undisclosed impact on Funkos earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) margin.\r\nOn August 4, 2022, Funko held an earnings call with analysts and explained that it had recently made the difficult decision to delay the remaining [ERP implementation] steps until 2023, noting that Funko did not want to impair the momentum that we have today by shifting to a platform that we felt wasnt yet fully ready to support our business. On this news, the price of Funko stock declined more than 18%.\r\nThen, on November 3, 2022, Funko reported earnings per share that badly missed analyst estimates. Funko also dramatically lowered its fiscal year 2022 guidance. On this news, the price of Funko stock declined more than 59%.\r\nFinally, on March 1, 2023, Funko announced its fiscal year 2022 financial results. Funkos net income for fiscal year 2022 decreased to a $5.2 million loss, its adjusted EBITDA margin decreased to 7.4%, and its adjusted earnings per diluted share came in well below prior estimates at just $0.57 per share. On this news, the price of Funko stock declined more than 29%, further damaging investors.\r\nTHE LEAD PLAINTIFF PROCESS: The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 permits any investor who purchased or acquired Funko common stock on a U.S. open market during the Class Period to seek appointment as lead plaintiff of the Funko class action lawsuit. A lead plaintiff is generally the movant with the greatest financial interest in the relief sought by the putative class who is also typical and adequate of the putative class. A lead plaintiff acts on behalf of all other class members in directing the Funko class action lawsuit. The lead plaintiff can select a law firm of its choice to litigate the Funko class action lawsuit. An investors ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff of the Funko class action lawsuit.\r\nABOUT ROBBINS GELLER: Robbins Geller is one of the worlds leading complex class action firms representing plaintiffs in securities fraud cases. The Firm is ranked #1 on the most recent ISS Securities Class Action Services Top 50 Report for recovering more than $1.75 billion for investors in 2022 the third year in a row Robbins Geller tops the list.

        "full_text": "Disney World is constantly working on updates around its stores, parks, and hotels, and now we\u2019ve got some clues about what changes could be coming next!\r\nMagic Kingdom\r\nWe constantly look at the latest permits filed that could be related to Disney projects to see what is being planned for the future. We\u2019ve seen permits indicating possible restaurant remodels,changes at Magic Kingdom rides, and more. So now let\u2019s take a closer look at what other updates could be hitting popular Disney World spots soon!\r\nBefore we dive in, we want to note that technically what we look at are called Notices of Commencement. These typically indicate that work on projects at these addresses could start soon. Here\u2019s what type of work we could see in the next few months.\r\nHotel News\r\nWe\u2019re back with ANOTHER update from Disney\u2019s Grand Floridian Resort &amp; Spa.\u00a0We\u2019ve seen a few different permits filed for the hotel in the past related to its main building and other spots, and now ANOTHER has been filed.\r\nOn the one hand, the continued filing of these permits related to the Grand Floridian is not surprising given the amount of ongoing construction there. But we do think this permit is particularly interesting.\r\nDisney\u2019s Grand Floridian lobby\r\nWhy? Well, the location of the work is 4401 Floridian Way, which is tied to the Grand Floridian\u2019s main building. But the really interesting part is the contractor listed on the permit \u2014 Friedrich Walkins Company. According to their website, this company does a number of things including working as a general contractor, designing builds, and\u2026hotel renovations. Hmm\u2026fascinating.\r\nTheir website displays many projects they\u2019ve worked on for Disney specifically, including hotel renovations at Disney\u2019s Old Key West Resort, Disney\u2019s All-Star Sports Resort (and All-Star Music), Disney\u2019s Port Orleans Resort, Disney\u2019s BoardWalk Resort, and more.\r\nGrand Floridian Lobby 2022\r\nThe filing of this permit with this specific contractor is of particular interest mainly because Disney previously announced that the Grand Floridian lobby would be undergoing a refurbishment. Could this be the permit to indicate that those changes will be taking place soon? It\u2019s not clear.\r\nThe permit only notes that it is for \u201cgeneral construction\u201d (not much in terms of details there), and is not set to expire until June 4th, 2024. So it\u2019s possible that this is just a permit for other work, but we\u2019ll certainly look for updates.\r\nA Store UPDATE\r\nNext up, we have a very interesting permit related to a Disney Springs store \u2014 specifically, the oh-so-popular LEGO store. The permit specifies that the work that will be done is the \u201cinstallation of temp. animat[]ed characters in planter.\u201d\r\nThat alone makes this unique \u2014 what temp. animated characters could be coming to planters at the LEGO store? This almost sounds like it could be for the installation of new LEGO statues (perhaps outside the store) that maybe move a little? It\u2019s been a while since we\u2019ve seen new LEGO statues outside the store so that would be a cool possibility.\r\nLEGO Store Disney Springs\r\nThe contractor involved in Southeastern Lightning Solutions,\u00a0who we\u2019ve seen listed on other permits related to work in Disney Springs. According to their website, this contractor has worked on a number of large signs (sometimes illuminated), typically for restaurants or stores like AutoZone, Waffle House, and more.\r\nThis permit is set to automatically expire 1 year from June 6th, 2023, so we\u2019ll have to see what changes take place there. Another permit related to the LEGO store also involving Southeastern Lighting Solutions has been filed, though that one is just for \u201cgeneral construction,\u201d so we\u2019ll watch for updates.\r\nRide Changes\r\nWhen it comes to ride changes, there are two main ones we want to tackle. First, there\u2019s a permit related to work at the future home of Tiana\u2019s Bayou Adventure. We\u2019ve seen quite a few of these recently, but this is a newer one for the \u201cfab\u201d (which we expect means fabrication) and \u201cinstall of aluminum &amp; FRP items.\u201d It looks like FRP items could be fiberglass-reinforced plastics.\r\nConstruction\r\nThe owner of the property is listed as Walt Disney Imagineering, which can sometimes signal important changes coming to a ride on property. The contractor working on this is Mecca Productions, Inc. which we\u2019ve seen involved in other work around Magic Kingdom before.\r\nAccording to their LinkedIn, \u201cMecca Productions is a full service custom fabrication and design facility.\u201d They are reportedly the country\u2019s \u201cleading Halloween fabricator\u201d and describe themselves as being \u201ccommitted to delivering world-class experiences through the creative design and integration of themed environments for attractions, theme parks, museums, corporate events and more.\u201d\r\nConstruction\r\nThe permit is set to automatically expire 1 year from June 7th, 2023. Disney previously announced that a tiara-topped water tower will be debuting at this attraction in the summer, so it is interesting to see this permit filed now. It\u00a0could be related to that or related to a variety of other things.\r\nThere are a LOT of changes going on with this ride as it undergoes its massive transformation, so we\u2019ll continue to watch for any updates.\r\nNext, we have a permit for an address that links to the Cambodian Ruins at the Jungle Cruise ride. The work to be done here is only noted as \u201cgeneral construction.\u201d It is set to be completed by Adena Corporation and the expiration date is June 2nd, 2024.\r\nWhat\u2019s interesting about this is that it is the second permit we\u2019ve seen filed recently related to the Jungle Cruise. The other was filed a few weeks ago for the main Jungle Cruise ride entrance building but also involves Adena Corporation and is not set to expire until May 25th, 2024.\r\nJungle Cruise\r\nAccording to the Adena website, they do a bunch of work on different projects, including amusement parks. Their experience includes amusement rides, indoor waterparks, lazy rivers, ride stations, roller coasters, thrill rides, water slide complexes, and wave pools.\r\nThe combination of their experience with rides in general and water-specific amusement park experiences makes their work on the Jungle Cruise particularly appropriate.\r\nJungle Cruise\r\nBut just what is going on here? It\u2019s not clear since this latest permit just says it\u2019s for \u201cgeneral construction\u201d and it won\u2019t expire for quite some time, but we\u2019ll keep our eyes peeled to see what might get altered on this classic attraction.\r\nFinally, we do want to quickly mention one other interesting ride-related permit, this time at\u2026The Haunted Mansion!\r\nHaunted Mansion in Disney World\r\nThere\u2019s not a lot of specificity here as the permit just says the work will be to \u201cProvide labor, material and/or electrical for construction,\u201d but it is interesting to see something filed for that address. The owner listed is not Imagineering (instead, the owner listed is Walt Disney World Resort \u2014 so that might indicate that it won\u2019t be a substantial change on the ride) and the contractor is Buena Vista Construction Company (Disney\u2019s internal contractor), so there\u2019s not a lot of information to gather from there.\r\nBut, considering the fact that the Hatbox Ghost is coming to The Haunted Mansion in 2023, we can\u2019t help but be hopeful that this\u00a0could relate to the iconic ghost. On the other hand, it could just be related to some general behind-the-scenes work, only time will tell!\r\nRed light on the hearse in the graveyard scene\r\nAnd those are the big permit updates for this week.

        "title": "ET Sustainability Forum: 'Carrot & stick' policy for faster green transition",
        "file_name": "2023-06-11_62359959.txt",
        "full_text": "Policy consistency, technological innovation, and penalty on polluters will together accelerate the energy transition and the countrys drive towards sustainability, top industry executives said during a panel discussion as part of the ET Sustainability Forum.In India, what we have suffered in the past is a lack of clear, sustainable longterm policy solutions. Now, it seems to have changed We need to be clear on one thing: we cannot keep changing this. So today its EV (electric vehicle) and tomorrow it should not become hybrid, or tomorrow it should not become some other technology solution, said Rajeev Chaba, CEO Emeritus, MG Motor India.\r\nLong-term policy is important, so the industry does not get confused. India has begun focusing on EVs as part of the larger drive to clean up road transport, which almost entirely depends on oil and gas and produces enormous emissions that must be tackled to achieve climate goals. The government has offered purchase subsidies and production-linked incentives with an aim to boost local production of EVs and help build its local supply chain, which is overwhelmingly dependent on China today.EV sales have risen and MG Motors Chaba expects its share in new passenger vehicle sales to rise to 30% in 2030 from just about 2-3% today.Consumers are asking for sustainable products, which are also affordable, he said, adding that the younger generation is willing to pay a premium for such products, while the older generation is still focused on cost.\r\nTo cut emissions, original equipment makers (OEMs) could reduce the consumption of metal in cars by beginning to use thinner but stronger steel, said Dilip Oommen, CEO of ArcelorMittal Nippon Steel India, a joint venture between the worlds leading steel companies.This thinner steel would, however, be more expensive on a per unit basis than the commonly used sheets today but due to its lower weight could ultimately reduce the overall cost for the carmakers.The point is the entire value chain has to be green, Oommen said, explaining how fuel providers, steel makers, and car manufacturers are all linked and all the participants in the value chain must act to have a significant impact on industrial emissions.Companies decarbonisation plans are under increased scrutiny from lenders and equity investors, Oommen said, adding that higher cost has been a big hurdle in the adoption of sustainable technologies. The cost of green hydrogen is prohibitive and it must come down to $1.5 per kg from $5-6 today, he said. And in the intermediate phase, the steelmakers can use natural gas in their blast furnaces.\r\nHe also pushed for the carbon capture utilisation and storage (CCUS) technology, arguing that the country should at least begin with carbon storage and the utilisation could follow. The need is to ensure that we reduce the use of fossil fuels for generating power, he said. May be (use) nuclear energy, which has its issues but at least its a clean fuel, he added.\r\nTapping scrap to reuse steel was a good idea but had its limitations, he said. The availability of scrap is going to diminish, he said, adding that as more countries try to pursue the same path, import of steel scraps will sharply reduce and India will have to largely depend on domestic scrap.\r\nMajor steel products would have a life of about 30 years and compared to todays requirements, India didnt produce or consume much steel 30 years ago, he said, explaining why the domestic supply of scrap would be limited.\r\nOommen also pushed for penalties for emitters and rewards for those who reduce emissions. India is beginning to develop a carbon market, which will encourage industries to switch to cleaner paths. Businesses need certain clarity of direction for a smoother transition, said Anirban Mukherjee, managing director &amp; partner - Boston Consulting Group (BCG).\r\nWe need to act fast, but we should not confuse speed with haste. The global economic recovery from the pandemic, the supply chain disruptions, and the Ukraine war brought on the world an unprecedented energy crisis in the past two years, pushing some countries to increase the use of highly polluting coal. The developed world faced a cost-of-living crisis and this cast doubt on whether an orderly energy transition can be achieved.\r\nWhile the broader national climate goals have been set, there was a need to go sector by sector and chart a preferred path to sustainability, Mukherjee said.\r\nDigitalisation in general and the increased use of artificial intelligence could come in handy in attacking climate problems by bringing in low-cost solutions, Mukherjee said, adding that startups could help in this. India still has limited startups in the energy and mobility value chain but will likely expand as the market scales up, he said. But if you look at the unicorns in Europe, they are across the board -- they are in carbon accounting, carbon markets, mobility, alternative fuels, hydrogen.\r\nTo really move fast and be effective, the industry will need a collaborative approach, said MG Motors Chaba. We know the building blocks. The need is to have a lot of partnerships and collaborations because one person or one institution cannot do it on its own, he said.\r\nTechnology companies are going to play a major role in societys green pursuit, Chaba said. They are going to disrupt all industries, he added.\r\nIndustry urged to use domestic tech, innovationIndia has laid a well-structured climate road map backed with the right policies and is on track to achieve its green goals, environment secretary Leena Nandan said while advising the industry to double up efforts at using local innovations and sustainable tech.\r\nWe are absolutely on track and raised the bar higher, Nandan said during the ET Sustainability Forums panel discussion, referring to Indias 2070 netzero goal as well as the pledge to source 50% of national energy consumption from non-fossil fuel sources by 2030.\r\nThe road map is very well structured, organised in terms of not just the thinking, but also the policy interventions. Globally, businesses are increasingly expected to switch swiftly to sustainable practices, and such demands, which initially came from the government or the regulators, are now also coming from other segments of society.\r\nWe are moving to a regime where consumers expect sustainability not just in terms of product but also the process, she added.\r\nIncreased consumer expectations may force companies to act faster. Also, the consumers expecting sustainable products and practices are also often those willing to pay a higher price for such products and services.\r\nRegulations with respect to sustainability by Sebi have also been evolving in the country. There is a lot of consultation (by Sebi) and that has been done on a regular basis with the industry so that there is a commonality of understanding, she said.\r\nAnd of course, the focus of the ESG is that it has to be something which does not ultimately become (some) kind of greenwashing because that is something that has become a concern.\r\nTechnology and innovation can play a critical role in the faster transition. There is a lot of innovation in our country. So now the time has come when the industry also has to take advantage of this innovation.\r\nDon\u2019t miss out on ET Prime stories!

The executive alleged that the former EuroDisney might not be profitable enough to support increased Cast Member wages.\r\nCredit: DLP Report on Twitter\r\nThe National Union of Autonomous Trade Unions (UNSA) responded to Rafalski on Friday, according to\u00a0Forbes.\u00a0They called a brief meeting with the President a \u201ctrainwreck\u201d and condemned \u201cher lack of sincerity and consideration.\u201d\r\n\u201cFor the UNSA Disneyland Paris, there is no question of moving on to something else,\u201d UNSA wrote in a statement. \u201cWe will continue to fight for better working conditions, a considerable quality of life and a significant increase for all DLP Cast Members.\u201d\r\nThey added that the President\u2019s response \u201crepresents a serious problem\u201d and \u201cinevitably leads to a situation that could become explosive.\u201d\r\nScreenshots via TikTok\r\nDisneyland Paris became profitable in 2017 when The Walt Disney Company purchased its remaining shares and regained control. Years of third-party operation kept the Disney Park in the red and destroyed its reputation for decades.\r\nWalt Disney World Resort\u00a0and\u00a0Disneyland Resort could be models for success for their French counterparts. In the last year, Cast Member unions spent months negotiating with The Walt Disney Company, with some employees striking for higher hourly wages and benefits. Both Disney Parks and their respective employee unions eventually agreed on new contracts.\r\nFollow Inside the Magic for live updates on the ongoing Disneyland Paris strike.

        "full_text": "Graeme Hart's company has begun developing 68 Cryers Rd, East Tamaki. Photo / suppliedHes voting with his feet: multi-billionaire Graeme Hart is clearly showing what he ranks as some of the most profitable sectors to invest in.\r\nWhile Hart is New Zealands richest individual with assets of around$12 billion, you might think the sectors he invests in sound a little boring.\r\nBut they are highly profitable because they are not only embedded in tens of millions of American households but they are for what people need. They also offer long-term stable returns. Rank Group, which Hart owns, houses businesses that operate internationally in the packaging, consumer goods and building supplies industries.\r\nRank owns assets which deliver what we wrap stuff in, our need for food and shelter and where we store stuff.\r\nAlthough he lives in Auckland, most of his investments are overseas.\r\nHowever, his focus has returned to New Zealand in recent years, with investment in property, including in South Aucklands warehouse/logistics projects.\r\nAnd just last week he and his wife Robyn showed their philanthropic side with a $6.5 million donation to Starship childrens hospital. \r\nHis Rank Group owns Fernbrook Property whose newest warehouse project is a 12,340sq m giant building at 68 Cryers Rd, East Tamaki, owned by Ranks Fernbrook Property (CR).\r\nThat big project wont be available to lease until the middle of 2025. Building A will be 12,340sq m of warehouses with 500sqm of offices and amenities, a shelter canopy of 2050sq m and 59 car parks. Building B will have a 9840sq m warehouse, the same area of offices and amenities, a 1620sq m canopy and the same number of car parks. Fernbrook Property has that project listed as CR1 and CR2.\r\nThe internal roof stud will be like the others: 16.5m inside, allowing for massive storage, all fully sprinklered, a high-spec floor and in what Fernbrook called the highly sought-after location.\r\nAlthough the storage sector on Kiwi soil is a new swerve, Harts businesses span a wide sector range.\r\nPackaging\r\nNYSE-listed Pactiv Evergreen Inc, making revenue of US$6.22 billion in 2022 and the global Graham Packaging, founded in 1970, headquartered in Pennsylvania.\r\nPreviously 100 per cent owned by Hart, Pactiv was floated in September 2020. The company specialises in packaging for food and beverage products in food serving, food merchandising and fresh beverage merchandising sectors. Through Rank Group, Hart has maintained a 78 per cent stake.\r\nWhether you grabbed a cup of coffee on your way into the office or enjoyed a home-cooked breakfast, the chances are that youve relied on packaging from Pactiv Evergreen today, Pactiv says on its website.\r\nFood manufacturing\r\nNasdaq-listed Reynolds Consumer Products with global headquarters in Illinois and Canadian headquarters in Ontarios Mississauga near Toronto. The company makes goods for food preparation, cooking, tableware, cleanup, waste and storage and claims to have a presence in 95 per cent of households across the United States. For the full year to December, Reynolds posted net profit of US$258m, on revenue of US$3.82b - up 7 per cent on the previous year. Hart still has a controlling 74 per cent stake.\r\nIn 2018, Graeme Hart and his son Harry bought Hubbard Foods, before that Hansells Food Group. Last year, the Harts bought ice cream company Emerald Foods Group, returning it to Kiwi ownership;\r\nTimber, trade sales\r\nNZs Carter Holt Harvey Timber manufactures wood products, supplied from three plants and distributes nationally. The trade-focused retailer Carters sits under this umbrella. CHH Timber is one of our largest and oldest timber building products suppliers, with big Kawerau, Kinleith and Nelson mills producing brands like Laserframe and Pinex.\r\nAuckland warehouse storage/logistics\r\nHeres where it gets close to home and theres some action on these shores. His Rank Groups Fernbrook Property has built two enormous Auckland warehouse projects, each twin-buildings, and just started on that third. These are new five-star green-rated south Auckland warehouses.\r\nNZ Companies Office records show 24 new Hart businesses have been registered since 2019, giving a clear indication of the direction in which the billionaire is heading.\r\nThe three warehouse projects, each with twin buildings, are estimated by sector insiders to have an end value somewhere in the $300 million region once theyre all up and fully leased. Alistair White, managing director and founder of Auckland planning and resource management consultancy Planning Focus, has been involved in many Hart deals. White lists Rank as one of his clients but wont talk about them.\r\nThe most successful warehouse project so far has gone to NZX-listed Synlait Milk which leased a huge new Wiri warehouse storage and office building from Harts company for its new southeast Asia plant-based export operation.\r\nA Synlait spokeswoman confirmed the company had leased adjoining warehouses and offices with on-site car parks at 9 Jerry Green St, Wiri. The property has 18,000sq m of storage space, 122 on-site car parks and ample truck turning space so containers can be packed and products hauled in and out of the huge buildings which have one vast open space within but are as tall as a five-level block.\r\nSynlait wont use the entire building right away. It has sublet a significant portion of the space it is renting, planning to grow into it over time, the spokeswoman said this month.\r\nFernbrook Property (JG), owned by Harts Rank Group, owns 9 Jerry Green St, property records show.\r\nThe second warehouse project is 90 Pavilion Dr, Mngere, on the edge of the Villa Maria Estate, itself about to become a $500m industrial office park by Goodman Property Trust. Two new buildings in a much sought-after location near Auckland Airport, built by Haydn &amp; Rollett, with a Green Star 5 rating, with 36 car parks, fully sprinklered, a high-stud clear-span international warehouse space with high-spec floors and offices.\r\nThe third project on Cryers Rd is still at the initial earthworks phase but like the other two sites, it is large, flat and with excellent transport connections, making it highly attractive to tenants.\r\nNZX listed Goodman Property Trust is one of his biggest competitors when it comes to tenants. It tells investors of positive leasing dynamics and a highly constrained market which means tenants need to secure space early and many are committing to longer lease terms. Its weighted average lease term is an attractive 6.4 years, giving a stable income during the current economic uncertainty.\r\nGoodman is so confident about the sector that it has $635.7m of development work on, with big tenants like NZ Post and Mainfreight gobbling up leases on its buildings.\r\nRents are rising fast too: Auckland industrial rents have recorded strong growth over the past year, with prime rents up 20.3 per cent and secondary rents up 15.6 per cent, Goodman told investors when it released its interim result last year.\r\nOne chart in the result showed the perfect double-whammy of factors: rents rising from $100 in 2012 to $160/sq m by 2022 yet vacancy rates falling from around 5 per cent in the prime rankings to below 1 per cent by last year.\r\nSo, thats why Harts companies are putting money into this highly lucrative sector.\r\nIts not Auckland Airport shares or Bitcoin, but it is a serious form of investment.",

Founded in 1975, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a Santa Clara, California-based multinational technology company with a $2.4 trillion market capitalization. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) delivered a 36.26% return since the beginning of the year, while its 12-month returns are up by\u00a0 29.17%. The stock closed at $326.79 per share on June 09, 2023.\r\nHere is what Baron Durable Advantage Fund has to say about Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)\u00a0in its Q1 2023 investor letter:\r\n\"Baron Durable Advantage Fund focuses on businesses with these characteristics. Microsoft, our largest holding, is a good case study of a business's ability to adapt and pivot after years of suffering the consequences of a stale management team that was resting on its laurels. The company's de facto monopoly position (Microsoft Windows + Office) in enterprise desktop and worker productivity suites in the client-server world made the company complacent and reluctant to take risks and continue to innovate. The stock languished for almost 15 years while Apple, Amazon, Google, and Facebook led the transition to mobile. Satya Nadella finally took the reins in 2014 and immediately changed the company's focus from the Windows-centric, on-prem legacy businesses to a cloud-first platform that could be accessed and used from any (mobile) device anywhere in the world. He also made the decision to open the platform to third parties, such as Linux, even though it was likely to hurt Microsoft's core Windows franchises. Nadella was willing to risk the high-margin on-prem business, recognizing that the world was going to change, and that cloud computing was going to be the future. This bold decision (and a massive multi-year investment) has reinvigorated the company and its stock, with Microsoft Azure, its cloud infrastructure business,\u00a0surpassing $55 billion in annualized recurring revenue\u00a0in the last quarter,\u00a0while still growing 38% year-over-year. The price of Microsoft stock has increased seven-fold since Satya Nadella took over as CEO.\"\r\nImage by Tawanda Razika from Pixabay\r\nOur calculations show that Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) tops our list of the 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds.

        "file_name": "2023-06-11_62359718.txt",
        "full_text": "On Saturday afternoon, a bunch of neo-Nazis decided to stand in front of the entrance to Walt Disney World waving Nazi flags and Ron DeSantis flags, shouting \"Go back to Mexico!\" and (I think) \"Get bigger AIDS in your cunthole\" at passerby. Like you do when you are a Florida neo-Nazi. \r\nVideo of the event was posted on Twitter by multiple people, including Rep. Anna V. Eskamani.\r\n\\u201cNazis outside of Walt Disney World right now \\u2014 absolutely disgusting.\\u201d\r\n Rep. Anna V. Eskamani \\ud83d\\udd28 (@Rep. Anna V. Eskamani \\ud83d\\udd28)\r\n 1686417857\r\nWhile it's possible that the neo-Nazis chose to demonstrate at Disney World so that they could take a ride on the Tea Cups after a long day spent yelling racial slurs at tourists, it seems a lot more likely that they chose it because of the ongoing feud between DeSantis and the Mouse. For the past year or so, DeSantis has been striking out at Disney after the company, which employs nearly 500,000 Floridians, came out against his insidious \"Don't Say Gay Bill.\" Given the fact that Orlando tourism which, let's be real, is Disney tourism generates approximately $75 billion for the state's economy and $5 billion in tax revenue, this was probably not the smartest move. But DeSantis isn't that swift and neither are Nazis.\r\nIn the replies to Eskaman's post, there are approximately a bajillion people claiming that the Nazis are actually FBI Agents doing an anti-DeSantis \"false flag,\" despite the fact that several have already been identified.\r\n\\u201cAnd another one \\n\\nhttps://t.co/rQXP0uc8aC\\u201d\r\n steven monacelli \\ud83c\\udd93 (@steven monacelli \\ud83c\\udd93)\r\n 1686431863\r\nBut really, what is it that they think neo-Nazis would find unappealing about Ron DeSantis? Maybe the fact that he's not an Aryan, but they like Mussolini, Pinochet and Franco well enough, so I'd have to imagine that DeSantis would also get a pass. Certainly they wouldn't have any policy disagreements with him. He hates immigrants, they hate immigrants. He wants to oppress LGBTQ+ people, they want to oppress LGBTQ+ people. \r\nIt's also pretty hard to put anything past the Right, given the fact that no small number of right wing Twitter users and, uh, Twitter owners, had some mighty high praise yesterday for ... the Unabomber.\r\nI don't think anyone has to admit that.\r\nTo be clear, in anything but perhaps math (and only because it's hardly as though I could check his work), Ted Kaczynski was definitely wrong. Because of the whole \"bombing people\" thing.\r\nSurely, if the Republican party is populated by people who can say, with a straight face, that \"You gotta give it to the Unabomber,\" twirling around Nazi flags in front of Disney World is hardly a stretch. \r\nDo your Amazon shopping through this link, because reasons.\r\nWonkette is independent and fully funded by readers like you.

Ron DeSantis outside Walt Disney World theme park in Orlando on Saturday.\r\nMultiple people can be seen waving red and black flags with swastikas, and at least one person can be seen holding a poster of DeSantis, according to videos circulating on social media and obtained by USA TODAY.\r\nOne photo of the scene shared to Twitter appears to show a \"DeSantis 2024 Make America Florida\" flag planted in the ground. Florida Rep. Anna Eskamani, of Orlando also shared a number of images of the scene.\r\n\"Its absolutely disgusting to see what has become a common presence of Nazis in Florida, and even more distributing when they are holding signs and flags that signal support for people like Governor DeSantis,\" Eskamani said. \"Every person, regardless of political ideology, should condemn this. Florida is a state built on diversity and we will always stand against bigotry and hate.\"\r\nRepresentatives for DeSantis and Disney did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\r\nThe Combat Antisemitism Movement, a non-partisan international organization, issued a statement on the incident and noted a \"similar occurrence\" happened at the same location last May.\r\nThe incident comes as DeSantis, who is running for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, has been embroiled in a feud with Disney for more than a year.\r\nEarly last year, Disney's former CEO criticized a Florida law that bars classroom instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity Florida's Parental Rights in Education Act, dubbed by critics as the \"Dont Say Gay\" law.\r\nA timeline: Graphics illustrate the length, bitterness of Disney-DeSantis dispute\r\nDeSantis responded to the criticism by signing legislation that stripped Disney of the right to govern the land that includes Disney World and overhauled the property's governing board. Disney then passed measures to deprive the new board of its power for decades.\r\nIn April, DeSantis announced new legislation to assert control over Disney and suggested that a prison could be built nearby. Days later, Disney sued DeSantis and other government officials, accusing them of retaliating against the company for engaging in exercising its constitutional rights.\r\nLast month, Disney executives canceled construction of a nearly $1 billion office complex in Orlando.\r\nDeSantis announced his presidential bid days later through a live Twitter event with SpaceX Founder Elon Musk.

        "full_text": "NOLENSVILLE, Tenn. The first encounter with racism that Harmony Kennedy can remember came in elementary school. On a playground, a girl picked up a leaf and said she wanted to clean the dirt from Harmonys skin.\r\nHarmony Kennedy, 16, is a high school student in Nolensville, Tenn.\r\nGeorge Walker IV, Associated Press\r\nIn sixth grade, a boy dropped trash on the floor and told her to pick it up, because youre a slave. She was stunned no one had ever said anything like that to her before.\r\nAs protests for racial justice broke out in 2020, white students at her Tennessee high school kneeled in the hallways and chanted, Black lives matter! in mocking tones. As she saw the students receive light punishments, she grew increasingly frustrated.\r\nSo when Tennessee began passing legislation that could limit the discussion and teaching of Black history, gender identity and race in the classroom, to Harmony, it felt like a gut punch.\r\nWhen I heard they were removing African American history, banning LGBTQ, I almost started crying, said Harmony, 16. Were not doing anything to anybody. Why do they care what we personally prefer, or what we look like?\r\nAs conservative politicians and activists push for limits on discussions of race, gender and sexuality, some students say the measures targeting aspects of their identity have made them less welcome in American schools the one place all kids are supposed to feel safe.\r\nSome of the new restrictions have been championed by conservative state leaders and legislatures, including Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who say they are necessary to counter liberal influence in schools.\u00a0\r\nBooks have been pulled from libraries. Some schools have insisted on using the names transgender students had before they transitioned. And teachers wary of breaking new rules have shied from discussions related to race, gender and other politically sensitive topics, even as students say they desperately need to see their lived experiences reflected in the classroom.\r\nAmong them are a transgender student at a Pennsylvania school where teachers are directed to use students birth names, a bisexual student in Florida who sensed a withdrawal of adult support, and Harmony, a Black student outside Nashville alarmed by efforts to restrict lessons on Black history.\r\nFor these and other students of color and LGBTQ+ kids, it can feel like their very existence is being rejected.\r\nIn late 2020, during the pandemic school closures, Leo Burchell started using different pronouns, trying on new clothes and shorter hair. The changes felt right.\r\nHigh school student Leo Burchell speaks at the Central Bucks School Board meeting about LGBTQ student rights Nov. 15, 2022, in Doylestown, Pa.\r\nRyan Collerd, Associated Press\r\nAt school outside Philadelphia, Leo started telling teachers about using a different name and they/them pronouns, and the teachers were immediately accepting. A shift to using he/him pronouns followed.\r\nI changed my name to Leo, and for a while it was tough, he said. I told some of my friends. I told the people close to me, but I wasnt ready to come out to everybody yet\u00a0 and I had the space to do that in my own time.\r\nTo tell his parents, Leo shared a poem he had written about his transition. He worried it would be hard for them, as parents who had always identified as girl parents to three daughters. His mom, dad, older and twin sister were all supportive.\r\nThen, over the past year, the Central Bucks School Districts board barred staff from using students chosen names or pronouns without parental permission.\r\nThe board passed what it called a neutrality policy that bars social and political advocacy in classrooms.\r\nEach step felt like chipping away at the spaces that made Leo feel safe enough to explore his gender identity.\r\nAcross the district, parents and students told the board stories of slurs, hate speech and sometimes violence directed toward transgender children. But other adults pressed forward in their effort to restrict inclusion. During one board meeting when a transgender student was speaking, rather than listening, a group of parents whispered to each other. One adult audibly asked: Is that a girl?\r\nOne man told the school board transgender people posed a risk of violence in bathrooms.\u00a0\r\nSo at the next board meeting, Leo spoke up. Attacking students based on who they are or who they love is wrong, he said. Leo has spoken regularly at meetings since.\r\nLeo worries about what school will be like for younger transgender students.\r\nI dont want my friends to be misgendered and deadnamed every single day just because they dont want to come out to their parents, Leo said.\u00a0\r\nJack Fitzgerald, a senior at J.P. Taravella High School who started the school's Gender and Sexuality Alliance club, sits for a portrait April 19 in Lauderhill, Fla.\r\nMarta Lavandier, Associated Press\r\nJack Fitzgerald, a high school student in Broward County, Florida, came out to friends by accident at first.\r\nAt a book club meeting, he blurted out: I dont really like romance books unless theyre gay. He hadnt told anyone he was bisexual, but it came out easily in a place where he felt comfortable and safe.\r\nLater, he would come out to his mother while watching television.\r\nSo, I am bi, he told her.\r\nAnd why are you telling me this? she said. A lifelong conservative, his mother told him she had long known about his sexuality. It was not a problem.\r\nThe confidence and relief he felt led Jack to start his schools gender and sexuality alliance club. Last year, as a junior, he led a school walkout to protest a new law that banned instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity for kindergarten to third grade.\u00a0\r\nJack was surprised by two things. Most students initially knew little about the bill. And once they learned about it, support for the walkout was overwhelming.\r\nTeachers have been more cautious.\r\nJack remembers talking to his debate teacher about covering some controversial topics. You have to realize, teachers have families, he told Jack, who took it as a comment on teachers worried about losing their jobs.\r\nThere also was a school board member, Debra Hixon, who won Jacks admiration when she spoke last year at a town hall event for teens. Hixon, who became widely known after her husband was killed in the 2018 Parkland school shooting, expressed support for LGBTQ+ students.\r\nI think I even told my mom. I was like, Oh, weve got to vote for her next time because she seems so impassioned, and she genuinely came across like she cared, he said.\r\nWhen Jack asked her in April how the school district would react to the new laws, Hixon said they were going to comply with the law.\r\nThe response shocked Jack. He thought back to how the district had stood up to the DeSantis administration over COVID-19 policies like mask mandates. When it came to protecting LGBTQ+ students, it seemed, there was no appetite for defiance.\r\nThey didnt even try to act like they were going to try, you know?\" he said. \"And it was so disappointing. It really took the air out of me.\r\nFrom Stonewall to today: 50+ years of modern LGBTQ+ history\r\nIn the early hours of June 28, 1969, the New York Police Department unwittingly helped start the modern LGBTQ+ rights movement. At the time, clubs with gay or lesbian patrons\u00a0weren't allowed to serve alcohol, but the Stonewall Inn still served booze to their customers, which gave police cause to raid the bar. The clientele pushed back, and 13 people were arrested. LGBTQ+ people and their allies protested for days. Among the crowd was transgender activist Marsha P. Johnson, who later founded Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries (STAR), an organization that provided resources for LGBTQ+ youth and sex workers.\r\nAfter the events at Stonewallwhich the NYPD eventually\u00a0apologized for in 2019more and more people pushed for LGBTQ+ equality. Activists organized the first LGBTQ+ marches in the United States and around the world, giving rise to annual Pride parades. In 1973, the American Psychological Association no longer considered being gay or lesbian a mental illness, and the first openly lesbian politicians were elected in the following year. Currently, openly gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer candidates occupy political offices at most levels of government, including in the U.S. House of Representatives, Senate, and state governorships.\u00a0\r\nThere is still more to be done, but since Stonewall, the government has passed laws banning discrimination based on sexual orientation, and the Supreme Court declared same-sex marriage legal. More than two dozen countries have passed legislation giving marriage rights to everyone.\r\nIn the military, it took decades for gay, lesbian, and bisexual service members to win\u00a0the right to enlist. And it wasn't until 2011 that LGBTQ+ troops could openly serve in the United States armed forces. While the Obama administration repealed the ban on transgender troops in 2016, former President Donald Trump effectively reinstated it in 2019 (though the ban was overturned by the Biden administration in 2021).\r\nTo find out more about LGBTQ+ history, Stacker combed through news reports and used data from GLSEN\u00a0to compile over 50 years of LGBTQ+ progress. Read on to see the evolution of this movement, from then to now.\r\nYou may also like:Looking back at 50 years of pride festivals\r\nJOHANNES EISELE/AFP // Getty Images\r\n1969: Stonewall Riots\r\nAnger erupted after New York City police arrested 13 people during a raid at the Stonewall Inn, a bar and safe space for the LGBTQ+ community.

Many say the event catalyzed the modern LGBTQ+ civil rights movement.\r\nDrew Angerer // Getty Images\r\n1969: Gay Liberation Front forms\r\nThe events of Stonewall led to the creation of the GLF, a group that organized the Christopher Street Liberation Day in New York in 1970now considered the first Pride parade.

In some U.S. states, people still need to undergo gender-reassignment surgery to legally change their gender.\r\nrbkomar // Shutterstock\r\n1972: UK has first Pride parade\r\nThe United Kingdom held the country's\u00a0first LGBTQ+ Pride parade on July 1, 1972.

Afterward, it became an enduring symbol of pride for the LGBTQ+ community. According to The Washington Post, Baker sometimes referred to himself as \"the Betsy Ross of gay liberation.\" He died in 2017 at the age of 65.\r\nSpencer Platt // Getty Images\r\n1981: Norway enacts anti-discrimination laws\r\nIn 1981, Norway amended its laws to include protections for LGBTQ+ people.\u00a0The legislation\u00a0stated that business owners couldn't discriminate against customers based on sexual orientation nor deny them access to public events.

Many of these bills focus on health careparticularly banning gender-affirming care and criminalizing this type of health care for the medical professionals who provide it and the legal guardians who permit it. For example, a bill introduced in Oklahoma proposes felony charges for providing gender-affirming care to people under 26 years old.\u00a0\r\nThere have also been significant victories for gender-affirming care in 2023. In January, Colorado, which used to be dubbed the \"Hate State,\" passed legislation protecting gender-affirming medical care as essential health care, becoming the first state to do so. Colorado's legal protections also apply to recipients of gender-affirming care from out of state, as well as medical providers both in and outside of Colorado.

        "full_text": "NOLENSVILLE, Tenn. The first encounter with racism that Harmony Kennedy can remember came in elementary school. On a playground, a girl picked up a leaf and said she wanted to clean the dirt from Harmonys skin.\r\nHarmony Kennedy, 16, is a high school student in Nolensville, Tenn.\r\nGeorge Walker IV, Associated Press\r\nIn sixth grade, a boy dropped trash on the floor and told her to pick it up, because youre a slave. She was stunned no one had ever said anything like that to her before.\r\nAs protests for racial justice broke out in 2020, white students at her Tennessee high school kneeled in the hallways and chanted, Black lives matter! in mocking tones. As she saw the students receive light punishments, she grew increasingly frustrated.\r\nSo when Tennessee began passing legislation that could limit the discussion and teaching of Black history, gender identity and race in the classroom, to Harmony, it felt like a gut punch.\r\nWhen I heard they were removing African American history, banning LGBTQ, I almost started crying, said Harmony, 16. Were not doing anything to anybody. Why do they care what we personally prefer, or what we look like?\r\nAs conservative politicians and activists push for limits on discussions of race, gender and sexuality, some students say the measures targeting aspects of their identity have made them less welcome in American schools the one place all kids are supposed to feel safe.\r\nSome of the new restrictions have been championed by conservative state leaders and legislatures, including Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who say they are necessary to counter liberal influence in schools.\u00a0\r\nBooks have been pulled from libraries. Some schools have insisted on using the names transgender students had before they transitioned. And teachers wary of breaking new rules have shied from discussions related to race, gender and other politically sensitive topics, even as students say they desperately need to see their lived experiences reflected in the classroom.\r\nAmong them are a transgender student at a Pennsylvania school where teachers are directed to use students birth names, a bisexual student in Florida who sensed a withdrawal of adult support, and Harmony, a Black student outside Nashville alarmed by efforts to restrict lessons on Black history.\r\nFor these and other students of color and LGBTQ+ kids, it can feel like their very existence is being rejected.\r\nIn late 2020, during the pandemic school closures, Leo Burchell started using different pronouns, trying on new clothes and shorter hair. The changes felt right.\r\nHigh school student Leo Burchell speaks at the Central Bucks School Board meeting about LGBTQ student rights Nov. 15, 2022, in Doylestown, Pa.\r\nRyan Collerd, Associated Press\r\nAt school outside Philadelphia, Leo started telling teachers about using a different name and they/them pronouns, and the teachers were immediately accepting. A shift to using he/him pronouns followed.\r\nI changed my name to Leo, and for a while it was tough, he said. I told some of my friends. I told the people close to me, but I wasnt ready to come out to everybody yet\u00a0 and I had the space to do that in my own time.\r\nTo tell his parents, Leo shared a poem he had written about his transition. He worried it would be hard for them, as parents who had always identified as girl parents to three daughters. His mom, dad, older and twin sister were all supportive.\r\nThen, over the past year, the Central Bucks School Districts board barred staff from using students chosen names or pronouns without parental permission.\r\nThe board passed what it called a neutrality policy that bars social and political advocacy in classrooms.\r\nEach step felt like chipping away at the spaces that made Leo feel safe enough to explore his gender identity.\r\nAcross the district, parents and students told the board stories of slurs, hate speech and sometimes violence directed toward transgender children. But other adults pressed forward in their effort to restrict inclusion. During one board meeting when a transgender student was speaking, rather than listening, a group of parents whispered to each other. One adult audibly asked: Is that a girl?\r\nOne man told the school board transgender people posed a risk of violence in bathrooms.\u00a0\r\nSo at the next board meeting, Leo spoke up. Attacking students based on who they are or who they love is wrong, he said. Leo has spoken regularly at meetings since.\r\nLeo worries about what school will be like for younger transgender students.\r\nI dont want my friends to be misgendered and deadnamed every single day just because they dont want to come out to their parents, Leo said.\u00a0\r\nJack Fitzgerald, a senior at J.P. Taravella High School who started the school's Gender and Sexuality Alliance club, sits for a portrait April 19 in Lauderhill, Fla.\r\nMarta Lavandier, Associated Press\r\nJack Fitzgerald, a high school student in Broward County, Florida, came out to friends by accident at first.\r\nAt a book club meeting, he blurted out: I dont really like romance books unless theyre gay. He hadnt told anyone he was bisexual, but it came out easily in a place where he felt comfortable and safe.\r\nLater, he would come out to his mother while watching television.\r\nSo, I am bi, he told her.\r\nAnd why are you telling me this? she said. A lifelong conservative, his mother told him she had long known about his sexuality. It was not a problem.\r\nThe confidence and relief he felt led Jack to start his schools gender and sexuality alliance club. Last year, as a junior, he led a school walkout to protest a new law that banned instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity for kindergarten to third grade.\u00a0\r\nJack was surprised by two things. Most students initially knew little about the bill. And once they learned about it, support for the walkout was overwhelming.\r\nTeachers have been more cautious.\r\nJack remembers talking to his debate teacher about covering some controversial topics. You have to realize, teachers have families, he told Jack, who took it as a comment on teachers worried about losing their jobs.\r\nThere also was a school board member, Debra Hixon, who won Jacks admiration when she spoke last year at a town hall event for teens. Hixon, who became widely known after her husband was killed in the 2018 Parkland school shooting, expressed support for LGBTQ+ students.\r\nI think I even told my mom. I was like, Oh, weve got to vote for her next time because she seems so impassioned, and she genuinely came across like she cared, he said.\r\nWhen Jack asked her in April how the school district would react to the new laws, Hixon said they were going to comply with the law.\r\nThe response shocked Jack. He thought back to how the district had stood up to the DeSantis administration over COVID-19 policies like mask mandates. When it came to protecting LGBTQ+ students, it seemed, there was no appetite for defiance.\r\nThey didnt even try to act like they were going to try, you know?\" he said. \"And it was so disappointing. It really took the air out of me.\r\nFrom Stonewall to today: 50+ years of modern LGBTQ+ history\r\nIn the early hours of June 28, 1969, the New York Police Department unwittingly helped start the modern LGBTQ+ rights movement. At the time, clubs with gay or lesbian patrons\u00a0weren't allowed to serve alcohol, but the Stonewall Inn still served booze to their customers, which gave police cause to raid the bar. The clientele pushed back, and 13 people were arrested. LGBTQ+ people and their allies protested for days. Among the crowd was transgender activist Marsha P. Johnson, who later founded Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries (STAR), an organization that provided resources for LGBTQ+ youth and sex workers.\r\nAfter the events at Stonewallwhich the NYPD eventually\u00a0apologized for in 2019more and more people pushed for LGBTQ+ equality. Activists organized the first LGBTQ+ marches in the United States and around the world, giving rise to annual Pride parades. In 1973, the American Psychological Association no longer considered being gay or lesbian a mental illness, and the first openly lesbian politicians were elected in the following year. Currently, openly gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer candidates occupy political offices at most levels of government, including in the U.S. House of Representatives, Senate, and state governorships.\u00a0\r\nThere is still more to be done, but since Stonewall, the government has passed laws banning discrimination based on sexual orientation, and the Supreme Court declared same-sex marriage legal. More than two dozen countries have passed legislation giving marriage rights to everyone.\r\nIn the military, it took decades for gay, lesbian, and bisexual service members to win\u00a0the right to enlist. And it wasn't until 2011 that LGBTQ+ troops could openly serve in the United States armed forces. While the Obama administration repealed the ban on transgender troops in 2016, former President Donald Trump effectively reinstated it in 2019 (though the ban was overturned by the Biden administration in 2021).\r\nTo find out more about LGBTQ+ history, Stacker combed through news reports and used data from GLSEN\u00a0to compile over 50 years of LGBTQ+ progress.

        "full_text": "NOLENSVILLE, Tenn. The first encounter with racism that Harmony Kennedy can remember came in elementary school. On a playground, a girl picked up a leaf and said she wanted to clean the dirt from Harmonys skin.\r\nHarmony Kennedy, 16, is a high school student in Nolensville, Tenn.\r\nGeorge Walker IV, Associated Press\r\nIn sixth grade, a boy dropped trash on the floor and told her to pick it up, because youre a slave. She was stunned no one had ever said anything like that to her before.\r\nAs protests for racial justice broke out in 2020, white students at her Tennessee high school kneeled in the hallways and chanted, Black lives matter! in mocking tones. As she saw the students receive light punishments, she grew increasingly frustrated.\r\nSo when Tennessee began passing legislation that could limit the discussion and teaching of Black history, gender identity and race in the classroom, to Harmony, it felt like a gut punch.\r\nWhen I heard they were removing African American history, banning LGBTQ, I almost started crying, said Harmony, 16. Were not doing anything to anybody. Why do they care what we personally prefer, or what we look like?\r\nAs conservative politicians and activists push for limits on discussions of race, gender and sexuality, some students say the measures targeting aspects of their identity have made them less welcome in American schools the one place all kids are supposed to feel safe.\r\nSome of the new restrictions have been championed by conservative state leaders and legislatures, including Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who say they are necessary to counter liberal influence in schools.\u00a0\r\nBooks have been pulled from libraries. Some schools have insisted on using the names transgender students had before they transitioned. And teachers wary of breaking new rules have shied from discussions related to race, gender and other politically sensitive topics, even as students say they desperately need to see their lived experiences reflected in the classroom.\r\nAmong them are a transgender student at a Pennsylvania school where teachers are directed to use students birth names, a bisexual student in Florida who sensed a withdrawal of adult support, and Harmony, a Black student outside Nashville alarmed by efforts to restrict lessons on Black history.\r\nFor these and other students of color and LGBTQ+ kids, it can feel like their very existence is being rejected.\r\nIn late 2020, during the pandemic school closures, Leo Burchell started using different pronouns, trying on new clothes and shorter hair. The changes felt right.\r\nHigh school student Leo Burchell speaks at the Central Bucks School Board meeting about LGBTQ student rights Nov. 15, 2022, in Doylestown, Pa.\r\nRyan Collerd, Associated Press\r\nAt school outside Philadelphia, Leo started telling teachers about using a different name and they/them pronouns, and the teachers were immediately accepting. A shift to using he/him pronouns followed.\r\nI changed my name to Leo, and for a while it was tough, he said. I told some of my friends. I told the people close to me, but I wasnt ready to come out to everybody yet\u00a0 and I had the space to do that in my own time.\r\nTo tell his parents, Leo shared a poem he had written about his transition. He worried it would be hard for them, as parents who had always identified as girl parents to three daughters. His mom, dad, older and twin sister were all supportive.\r\nThen, over the past year, the Central Bucks School Districts board barred staff from using students chosen names or pronouns without parental permission.\r\nThe board passed what it called a neutrality policy that bars social and political advocacy in classrooms.\r\nEach step felt like chipping away at the spaces that made Leo feel safe enough to explore his gender identity.\r\nAcross the district, parents and students told the board stories of slurs, hate speech and sometimes violence directed toward transgender children. But other adults pressed forward in their effort to restrict inclusion. During one board meeting when a transgender student was speaking, rather than listening, a group of parents whispered to each other. One adult audibly asked: Is that a girl?\r\nOne man told the school board transgender people posed a risk of violence in bathrooms.\u00a0\r\nSo at the next board meeting, Leo spoke up. Attacking students based on who they are or who they love is wrong, he said. Leo has spoken regularly at meetings since.\r\nLeo worries about what school will be like for younger transgender students.\r\nI dont want my friends to be misgendered and deadnamed every single day just because they dont want to come out to their parents, Leo said.\u00a0\r\nJack Fitzgerald, a senior at J.P. Taravella High School who started the school's Gender and Sexuality Alliance club, sits for a portrait April 19 in Lauderhill, Fla.\r\nMarta Lavandier, Associated Press\r\nJack Fitzgerald, a high school student in Broward County, Florida, came out to friends by accident at first.\r\nAt a book club meeting, he blurted out: I dont really like romance books unless theyre gay. He hadnt told anyone he was bisexual, but it came out easily in a place where he felt comfortable and safe.\r\nLater, he would come out to his mother while watching television.\r\nSo, I am bi, he told her.\r\nAnd why are you telling me this? she said. A lifelong conservative, his mother told him she had long known about his sexuality. It was not a problem.\r\nThe confidence and relief he felt led Jack to start his schools gender and sexuality alliance club. Last year, as a junior, he led a school walkout to protest a new law that banned instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity for kindergarten to third grade.\u00a0\r\nJack was surprised by two things. Most students initially knew little about the bill. And once they learned about it, support for the walkout was overwhelming.\r\nTeachers have been more cautious.\r\nJack remembers talking to his debate teacher about covering some controversial topics. You have to realize, teachers have families, he told Jack, who took it as a comment on teachers worried about losing their jobs.\r\nThere also was a school board member, Debra Hixon, who won Jacks admiration when she spoke last year at a town hall event for teens. Hixon, who became widely known after her husband was killed in the 2018 Parkland school shooting, expressed support for LGBTQ+ students.\r\nI think I even told my mom. I was like, Oh, weve got to vote for her next time because she seems so impassioned, and she genuinely came across like she cared, he said.\r\nWhen Jack asked her in April how the school district would react to the new laws, Hixon said they were going to comply with the law.\r\nThe response shocked Jack. He thought back to how the district had stood up to the DeSantis administration over COVID-19 policies like mask mandates. When it came to protecting LGBTQ+ students, it seemed, there was no appetite for defiance.\r\nThey didnt even try to act like they were going to try, you know?\" he said. \"And it was so disappointing.

        "full_text": "NOLENSVILLE, Tenn. The first encounter with racism that Harmony Kennedy can remember came in elementary school. On a playground, a girl picked up a leaf and said she wanted to clean the dirt from Harmonys skin.\r\nHarmony Kennedy, 16, is a high school student in Nolensville, Tenn.\r\nGeorge Walker IV, Associated Press\r\nIn sixth grade, a boy dropped trash on the floor and told her to pick it up, because youre a slave. She was stunned no one had ever said anything like that to her before.\r\nAs protests for racial justice broke out in 2020, white students at her Tennessee high school kneeled in the hallways and chanted, Black lives matter! in mocking tones. As she saw the students receive light punishments, she grew increasingly frustrated.\r\nSo when Tennessee began passing legislation that could limit the discussion and teaching of Black history, gender identity and race in the classroom, to Harmony, it felt like a gut punch.\r\nWhen I heard they were removing African American history, banning LGBTQ, I almost started crying, said Harmony, 16. Were not doing anything to anybody. Why do they care what we personally prefer, or what we look like?\r\nAs conservative politicians and activists push for limits on discussions of race, gender and sexuality, some students say the measures targeting aspects of their identity have made them less welcome in American schools the one place all kids are supposed to feel safe.\r\nSome of the new restrictions have been championed by conservative state leaders and legislatures, including Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who say they are necessary to counter liberal influence in schools.\u00a0\r\nBooks have been pulled from libraries. Some schools have insisted on using the names transgender students had before they transitioned. And teachers wary of breaking new rules have shied from discussions related to race, gender and other politically sensitive topics, even as students say they desperately need to see their lived experiences reflected in the classroom.\r\nAmong them are a transgender student at a Pennsylvania school where teachers are directed to use students birth names, a bisexual student in Florida who sensed a withdrawal of adult support, and Harmony, a Black student outside Nashville alarmed by efforts to restrict lessons on Black history.\r\nFor these and other students of color and LGBTQ+ kids, it can feel like their very existence is being rejected.\r\nIn late 2020, during the pandemic school closures, Leo Burchell started using different pronouns, trying on new clothes and shorter hair. The changes felt right.\r\nHigh school student Leo Burchell speaks at the Central Bucks School Board meeting about LGBTQ student rights Nov. 15, 2022, in Doylestown, Pa.\r\nRyan Collerd, Associated Press\r\nAt school outside Philadelphia, Leo started telling teachers about using a different name and they/them pronouns, and the teachers were immediately accepting. A shift to using he/him pronouns followed.\r\nI changed my name to Leo, and for a while it was tough, he said. I told some of my friends. I told the people close to me, but I wasnt ready to come out to everybody yet\u00a0 and I had the space to do that in my own time.\r\nTo tell his parents, Leo shared a poem he had written about his transition. He worried it would be hard for them, as parents who had always identified as girl parents to three daughters. His mom, dad, older and twin sister were all supportive.\r\nThen, over the past year, the Central Bucks School Districts board barred staff from using students chosen names or pronouns without parental permission.\r\nThe board passed what it called a neutrality policy that bars social and political advocacy in classrooms.\r\nEach step felt like chipping away at the spaces that made Leo feel safe enough to explore his gender identity.\r\nAcross the district, parents and students told the board stories of slurs, hate speech and sometimes violence directed toward transgender children. But other adults pressed forward in their effort to restrict inclusion. During one board meeting when a transgender student was speaking, rather than listening, a group of parents whispered to each other. One adult audibly asked: Is that a girl?\r\nOne man told the school board transgender people posed a risk of violence in bathrooms.\u00a0\r\nSo at the next board meeting, Leo spoke up. Attacking students based on who they are or who they love is wrong, he said. Leo has spoken regularly at meetings since.\r\nLeo worries about what school will be like for younger transgender students.\r\nI dont want my friends to be misgendered and deadnamed every single day just because they dont want to come out to their parents, Leo said.\u00a0\r\nJack Fitzgerald, a senior at J.P. Taravella High School who started the school's Gender and Sexuality Alliance club, sits for a portrait April 19 in Lauderhill, Fla.\r\nMarta Lavandier, Associated Press\r\nJack Fitzgerald, a high school student in Broward County, Florida, came out to friends by accident at first.\r\nAt a book club meeting, he blurted out: I dont really like romance books unless theyre gay. He hadnt told anyone he was bisexual, but it came out easily in a place where he felt comfortable and safe.\r\nLater, he would come out to his mother while watching television.\r\nSo, I am bi, he told her.\r\nAnd why are you telling me this? she said. A lifelong conservative, his mother told him she had long known about his sexuality. It was not a problem.\r\nThe confidence and relief he felt led Jack to start his schools gender and sexuality alliance club. Last year, as a junior, he led a school walkout to protest a new law that banned instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity for kindergarten to third grade.\u00a0\r\nJack was surprised by two things. Most students initially knew little about the bill. And once they learned about it, support for the walkout was overwhelming.\r\nTeachers have been more cautious.\r\nJack remembers talking to his debate teacher about covering some controversial topics. You have to realize, teachers have families, he told Jack, who took it as a comment on teachers worried about losing their jobs.\r\nThere also was a school board member, Debra Hixon, who won Jacks admiration when she spoke last year at a town hall event for teens. Hixon, who became widely known after her husband was killed in the 2018 Parkland school shooting, expressed support for LGBTQ+ students.\r\nI think I even told my mom. I was like, Oh, weve got to vote for her next time because she seems so impassioned, and she genuinely came across like she cared, he said.\r\nWhen Jack asked her in April how the school district would react to the new laws, Hixon said they were going to comply with the law.\r\nThe response shocked Jack. He thought back to how the district had stood up to the DeSantis administration over COVID-19 policies like mask mandates. When it came to protecting LGBTQ+ students, it seemed, there was no appetite for defiance.\r\nThey didnt even try to act like they were going to try, you know?\" he said. \"And it was so disappointing.

Many of these bills focus on health careparticularly banning gender-affirming care and criminalizing this type of health care for the medical professionals who provide it and the legal guardians who permit it. For example, a bill introduced in Oklahoma proposes felony charges for providing gender-affirming care to people under 26 years old.\u00a0\r\nThere have also been significant victories for gender-affirming care in 2023. In January, Colorado, which used to be dubbed the \"Hate State,\" passed legislation protecting gender-affirming medical care as essential health care, becoming the first state to do so. Colorado's legal protections also apply to recipients of gender-affirming care from out of state, as well as medical providers both in and outside of Colorado. Four other statesIllinois, Maryland, New Mexico, and Minnesotahave passed similar legislation protecting transgender health care.\r\nJustin Sullivan // Getty Images\r\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!",

        "file_name": "2023-06-11_62359776.txt",
        "full_text": "Key Insights\r\n<ul><li>The considerable ownership by private companies in George Weston indicates that they collectively have a greater say in management and business strategy\r\n</li><li>Wittington Investments, Limited owns 56% of the company\r\n</li><li> 15% of George Weston is held by Institutions\r\n</li></ul>If you want to know who really controls George Weston Limited (TSE:WN), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are private companies with 56% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).\r\nAs a result, private companies as a group endured the highest losses last week after market cap fell by CA$1.0b.\r\nLet's delve deeper into each type of owner of George Weston, beginning with the chart below.\r\n See our latest analysis for George Weston \r\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About George Weston?\r\nInstitutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.\r\nGeorge Weston already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of George Weston, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.\r\nearnings-and-revenue-growth\r\nGeorge Weston is not owned by hedge funds. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is Wittington Investments, Limited with 56% of shares outstanding. This implies that they have majority interest control of the future of the company. RBC Global Asset Management Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 3.1% of common stock, and The Vanguard Group, Inc. holds about 1.8% of the company stock.\r\nWhile it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.\r\nInsider Ownership Of George Weston\r\nThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.\r\nI generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.\r\nOur information suggests that George Weston Limited insiders own under 1% of the company. But they may have an indirect interest through a corporate structure that we haven't picked up on. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own CA$50m worth of shares (at current prices). In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to see if those insiders have been buying or selling. \r\nGeneral Public Ownership\r\nThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 29% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.\r\nPrivate Company Ownership\r\nWe can see that Private Companies own 56%, of the shares on issue. Private companies may be related parties. Sometimes insiders have an interest in a public company through a holding in a private company, rather than in their own capacity as an individual. While it's hard to draw any broad stroke conclusions, it is worth noting as an area for further research.\r\nNext Steps:\r\nWhile it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Like risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted 2 warning signs for George Weston (of which 1 is significant!) you should know about.\r\nBut ultimately it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.\r\nNB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

        "full_text": "The prime minister is lining up a technology entrepreneur who co-founded the music industry business Songkick to spearhead a \u00a3100m government taskforce set up to forge Britain's future artificial intelligence capability.\r\nSky News has learnt that Ian Hogarth, who is now an investor in dozens of start-ups, is a leading candidate to chair the Foundation Models Taskforce (FMT), which was unveiled by Rishi Sunak in April.\r\nOne Whitehall source said Mr Hogarth had emerged as the frontrunner for the post in recent days.\r\nThe Foundation Models Taskforce is being established to accelerate the UK's adoption of safe AI models in areas such as the 'large language' platforms - like ChatGPT and Google's Bard - which have become the subject of intense scrutiny in recent months.\r\nThe government intends that it is modelled on the COVID Vaccines Taskforce, and is likely to allocate additional funding to it in future, according to the source.\r\n\"The taskforce will play a crucial role in ensuring the major, multi-year funding announced at the budget for compute is strategically invested to prioritise and strengthen the UK's capability in foundation models,\" the government said in April.\r\nLast week, Mr Sunak held talks with the US President, Joe Biden, to discuss the future opportunities and threats posed by AI.\r\nMore on Artificial Intelligence\r\nThe government subsequently announced that Britain would host a global summit in the autumn to debate the regulatory \"guardrails\" that will mitigate future risks from the technology.\r\nThe prime minister is determined to establish the UK as a global hub for the development of AI technology, and also for its oversight, as he seeks to demonstrate that post-Brexit Britain can be an international destination for major tech investment.\r\nAt the time of the FMT's unveiling, Mr Sunak said: \"Harnessing the potential of AI provides enormous opportunities to grow our economy, create better-paid jobs, and build a better future through advances in healthcare and security.\r\n\"By investing in emerging technologies through our new expert taskforce, we can continue to lead the way in developing safe and trustworthy AI as part of shaping a more innovative UK economy.\"\r\nIn the past month, he has met the bosses of tech giants including OpenAI and Google's parent, Alphabet, to discuss the sudden explosion of AI adoption across the economy.\r\nLast week, another entrepreneur, Matt Clifford, who chairs the government's Advanced Research and Innovation Agency, issued another warning about the technology.\r\n\"If we try and create artificial intelligence that is more intelligent than humans and we don't know how to control it, then that's going to create a potential for all sorts of risks now and in the future... it's right that it should be very high on the policymakers' agendas,\" he said.\r\nMr Clifford is also advising on the establishment of the FMT, according to the government's announcement in April.\r\nA government insider said Mr Hogarth's appointment could yet fall through, but that it was expected to be finalised shortly, with London Tech Week being staged this week.\r\nMr Hogarth is a visiting professor of practice at the UCL Institute for Innovation and Public Purpose (IIPP), and an investor in more than 40 start-ups, according to an online biography.\r\nHe is also a partner at Plural Platforms, a venture capital firm.\r\nHe orchestrated the sale of Songkick, following an anti-trust case which resulted in Ticketmaster paying a $130m settlement.\r\nA government spokesperson said: \"The recruitment process for the chair of the Foundation Models Taskforce remains ongoing.\"",

        "file_name": "2023-06-11_62359826.txt",
        "full_text": "A good way to invest is to pick a broad secular trend and put your money into companies riding the wave. Those companies can benefit from outsize growth opportunities as the world changes and consumer behavior shifts. Your portfolio's returns could get a boost as well.\u00a0\r\nStreaming entertainment is one such space that continues to receive a lot of attention. The internet completely revolutionized how people watch video entertainment, and there are numerous companies all vying for a piece of the growing pie.\u00a0\r\nThe good news is that investors don't have to try to pick a single winner in the streaming industry. Here's why.\u00a0\r\nImage source: Getty Images.\r\nBetting on the entire trend\u00a0\r\nOne course of action would be to wait until the so-called streaming wars are over to see who the winners end up being. That would take the guesswork out of the equation and make it so that investors don't have to try to predict the future competitive landscape of a complex and changing industry.\u00a0\r\nStreaming is not a new phenomenon, though, and there are already some winners. With over 232 million paid memberships as of March 31, Netflix\u00a0deserves credit for pioneering streaming. Co-founder and former CEO Reed Hastings correctly predicted that video entertainment would become extremely popular because it was much more convenient and affordable for consumers.\u00a0\r\nHe was right, and he positioned his business to capture this opportunity before others caught on. Netflix's first-mover advantage resulted in it finally producing positive free cash flow, with $1.6 billion in 2022 and a projected $3.5 billion this year.\u00a0\r\nWalt Disney, which counts 231 million subscriptions to Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+, can also be viewed as a dominant player in streaming. What's really impressive is that Disney+, with 158 million customers, was launched as recently as November 2019, so its growth has been noteworthy. Owning incredibly valuable intellectual property, including Lucasfilm, Marvel Studios, and Pixar, allows the business to find new ways to monetize the characters and storylines that connect well with audiences.\u00a0\r\nThe issue, though, is that Walt Disney's direct-to-consumer (DTC) segment, which houses its streaming operations, is far from profitable. It posted an operating loss of $1.7 billion in the six months ended April 1.\u00a0\r\nThere are more options besides these two. Warner Bros Discovery, home to the new Max service that combined HBO Max and Discovery+, has 98 million subscribers, but the company is saddled with a massive debt burden of nearly $50 billion.\u00a0\u00a0\r\nBecause the competition is so intense, instead of trying to pick one winner, investors might be better served by taking a basket approach, owning multiple companies in the streaming space as a way to play the secular trend.\u00a0\r\nLots of companies are riding the wave\r\nOutside of the big-name content providers, there are platform providers in the streaming space. Roku immediately comes to mind. CEO Anthony Wood is building the leading smart-TV operating system, connecting viewers, content companies like the ones I just discussed, and advertisers that are looking to target consumers in a connected-TV environment.\r\n The thesis is simple.

        "full_text": "A good way to invest is to pick a broad secular trend and put your money into companies riding the wave. Those companies can benefit from outsize growth opportunities as the world changes and consumer behavior shifts. Your portfolio's returns could get a boost as well.\u00a0\r\nStreaming entertainment is one such space that continues to receive a lot of attention. The internet completely revolutionized how people watch video entertainment, and there are numerous companies all vying for a piece of the growing pie.\u00a0\r\nThe good news is that investors don't have to try to pick a single winner in the streaming industry. Here's why.\u00a0\r\nImage source: Getty Images.\r\nBetting on the entire trend\u00a0\r\nOne course of action would be to wait until the so-called streaming wars are over to see who the winners end up being. That would take the guesswork out of the equation and make it so that investors don't have to try to predict the future competitive landscape of a complex and changing industry.\u00a0\r\nStreaming is not a new phenomenon, though, and there are already some winners. With over 232 million paid memberships as of March 31, Netflix\u00a0deserves credit for pioneering streaming. Co-founder and former CEO Reed Hastings correctly predicted that video entertainment would become extremely popular because it was much more convenient and affordable for consumers.\u00a0\r\nHe was right, and he positioned his business to capture this opportunity before others caught on. Netflix's first-mover advantage resulted in it finally producing positive free cash flow, with $1.6 billion in 2022 and a projected $3.5 billion this year.\u00a0\r\nWalt Disney, which counts 231 million subscriptions to Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+, can also be viewed as a dominant player in streaming. What's really impressive is that Disney+, with 158 million customers, was launched as recently as November 2019, so its growth has been noteworthy. Owning incredibly valuable intellectual property, including Lucasfilm, Marvel Studios, and Pixar, allows the business to find new ways to monetize the characters and storylines that connect well with audiences.\u00a0\r\nThe issue, though, is that Walt Disney's direct-to-consumer (DTC) segment, which houses its streaming operations, is far from profitable. It posted an operating loss of $1.7 billion in the six months ended April 1.\u00a0\r\nThere are more options besides these two. Warner Bros Discovery, home to the new Max service that combined HBO Max and Discovery+, has 98 million subscribers, but the company is saddled with a massive debt burden of nearly $50 billion.\u00a0\u00a0\r\nBecause the competition is so intense, instead of trying to pick one winner, investors might be better served by taking a basket approach, owning multiple companies in the streaming space as a way to play the secular trend.\u00a0\r\nLots of companies are riding the wave\r\nOutside of the big-name content providers, there are platform providers in the streaming space. Roku immediately comes to mind. CEO Anthony Wood is building the leading smart-TV operating system, connecting viewers, content companies like the ones I just discussed, and advertisers that are looking to target consumers in a connected-TV environment.\r\n The thesis is simple. As streaming continues to become more popular, with viewers and ad dollars making the shift, Roku will benefit as the platform that grows with the overall industry.\u00a0\r\nAmazon\u00a0and Apple have unique positions in the streaming landscape. Not only do they have their own direct-to-consumer offerings in Prime Video and Apple TV+, but they also have connected-TV platforms, with Amazon's Fire TV Stick and Apple TV.

        "file_name": "2023-06-11_62359847.txt",
        "full_text": "In late 2021, investors cheered General Electric's (GE 0.22%) decision to split itself into three public companies. However, by the middle of 2022, the market had soured on GE. After peaking above $110 following the breakup announcement, GE stock slid all the way to $60 -- a level not seen since the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic -- by July 2022.\r\nInvestors have regained their enthusiasm for the breakup in 2023, as GE stock has roared higher. In fact, shares of General Electric -- and its GE Healthcare Technologies(GEHC -0.84%) spin-off -- have more than doubled in value in the last 11 months. The upcoming spin-off of GE's energy businesses could enable further gains in 2024.\r\nInvestors lose faith\r\nGeneral Electric couldn't seem to catch a break in 2022. In its first-quarter earnings presentation, the company highlighted a slew of near-term challenges it was facing, including high inflation, the Russia-Ukraine war, and supply chain constraints. These factors slowed the aerospace unit's recovery and pressured margins in the healthcare unit all year.\r\nMeanwhile, the renewable energy business struggled throughout 2022. For the full year, it reported a $2.24 billion operating loss and burned $2 billion of cash on a 17% revenue decline. This fell far short of management's expectations entering the year.\r\nThese headwinds and fears about whether conditions could worsen likely explained why GE stock plunged from around $100 in January 2022 to as low as $60 six months later.\r\nA spectacular run\r\nFortunately, many of these business pressures faded as 2022 progressed. By the fourth quarter, all GE's main business units, other than renewable energy, were reporting year-over-year profit growth. This helped GE stock begin recovering in the second half of 2022.\r\nThe spin-off of GE Healthcare in early January turbocharged this momentum. Within less than a month of the spin-off becoming official, shares of both GE and GE Healthcare rose more than 20%. And GE stock has continued to climb thanks to strong Q1 results, a favorable aviation demand backdrop, and bullish medium- and long-term forecasts the company released at its investor day in March.\r\nIndeed, GE stock ended last week at $106.30, just shy of the new 52-week high it set on Wednesday. That's up more than 75% from where it bottomed out last July.\r\nMoreover, in conjunction with the healthcare spin-off in early January, GE shareholders received one GE Healthcare share for every three GE shares they held. GE Healthcare stock currently sits at $77.10. That equates to $25.70 for a third of a share. Adding that to the current GE stock price, shareholders who have held both stocks now have $132 of value for every pre-spin-off GE share -- up 120% in 11 months. GE stock last traded at that level in early 2018.\r\nOne more catalyst\r\nToday, GE has a market cap of approximately $116 billion, which is at least in the ballpark of its intrinsic value. Even so, the upcoming spin-off of GE Vernova -- which will encompass the company's power and renewable energy segments -- could unlock a little more upside.\r\nWhile GE's energy-related businesses generated nearly $30 billion of revenue last year, they were collectively unprofitable and cash-flow negative. So far, 2023 is shaping up to be only slightly better.\u00a0Management expects profitability and cash flow to improve dramatically next year, but considering GE's recent track record in these business segments, investors could reasonably be skeptical of the company's targets.\r\nIn short, the power and renewable energy units have weighed heavily on GE's valuation in recent years, and that is probably still the case. GE Aerospace -- a fairly predictable high-growth, high-margin business -- will be much more appealing to many investors once it is independent of these less stable businesses. That could lead to a higher valuation for GE stock in a year or two, rewarding patient shareholders.",

        "file_name": "2023-06-11_62359890.txt",
        "full_text": "On a 3-mile stretch of farmland in southwest Michigan, Ford Motor Co. is building a battery factory. The\u00a0technology Ford needs\u00a0to make\u00a0cheap, stable batteries\u00a0to power electric vehicles will come from Chinas Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd., better known as CATL, the\u00a0worlds biggest battery manufacturer. By most measures, Fords deal with the Chinese giant is a coup for the state its getting a $3.5 billion investment in a 2.5-million-square-foot factory, thousands of new jobs and the ability to produce enough batteries annually to power 400,000 electric vehicles when the plant opens in 2026. But for anyone whos been paying attention, its a devastating moment of irony for the U.S.: The deal could have been the other way around.\r\nIn the mid-1990s, a compound called\u00a0lithium iron phosphate (LFP), the primary battery chemistry now used by CATL and most battery companies in China, was discovered by scientists at the University of Texas at Austin and commercialized a few years later by the startup A123 Systems LLC in Watertown, Massachusetts. In 2009, A123 was\u00a0awarded hundreds of millions of dollars by the Obama administration with the great hope that it would help kick-start production of electric cars in the U.S.. But it was too early. There wasnt demand for EVs, and car companies making vehicles that use less gas didnt want to risk relying on an unproven startup.\r\nBy 2012, A123 had filed for bankruptcy and become a symbol of government waste often mentioned in the same breath as\u00a0Solyndra, the California solar-panel maker\u00a0that filed for bankruptcy in 2011 after receiving a half-billion dollars in federal loan guarantees. To this day, Dave Vieau, A123s former chief executive officer, is dogged by occasional finger-wagging when people learn he ran the company. Youre the A123 guy who stole all the government money is a line hes gotten more than once.\r\nNow, almost 30 years after the discovery of LFP, the U.S. is scrambling to build its own battery supply chain, and the pioneer of the modern assembly line is turning to China to learn how to make the car of the 21st century. Its an unsubtle reminder that America learned the wrong lesson from A123. Rather than letting a potentially breakthrough technology, or a young company trying to commercialize that technology, live or die by the whims of the free market, the U.S. could have been committed to a much longer game. And rather than allowing a battery discovery to slip through its fingers and into the hands of whats now its greatest economic and geopolitical rival, the U.S. could have figured out how to nurture and protect a nascent industry that was inevitably going to encounter trial and error. With the wisdom of hindsight, A123 is a case for tweaking the orthodox rules of American capitalism in the age of competition with China.\r\n'China has just marched ahead'\r\nIn 2013, Chinas then-biggest auto parts company\u00a0purchased A123 out of bankruptcy. That year the Chinese government also began implementing its plan to build a domestic EV market at a breathtaking pace. A decade later, China accounts for 58% of the worlds EV sales and 83% of all lithium-ion battery manufacturing, according to BloombergNEF. Even if all of President Joe Bidens climate policies succeed in reviving American manufacturing, the U.S. is now at least a decade behind China when it comes to battery manufacturing, in terms of both the necessary technology and the capacity, industry experts say. China has just marched ahead with a very consistent strategy over the past 20 years, says Brian Engle, president-elect of NaatBatt International, a trade association that\u00a0advocates for battery development in North America. We create all kinds of really cool technology, and then we abandon it.\r\nSoon after A123s collapse, some of its engineers answered the call of Chinas young and booming battery industry. One eventually became the billionaire chairman of a\u00a0Chinese maker of carbon materials. A few of A123s former executives still wonder what would have happened if, at the time, the U.S. had found a way to keep the company going a government supply contract or even a sale to another American business. Given time and support, could A123 have eventually become a billion-dollar American battery behemoth, the linchpin in a homegrown battery supply chain?\r\nThe U.S. has an industrial policy. Heres the policy: We dont have one, says Jeff Chamberlain, who spent more than a decade at Argonne National Laboratory trying to commercialize battery tech before starting a venture capital firm in 2016. Im not saying we should become socialist or communist, but other countries that have decades-long industrial policies, theyre gonna eat our lunch.\r\nThe U.S. has an industrial policy. Heres the policy: We dont have one. Im not saying we should become socialist or communist, but other countries that have decades-long industrial policies, theyre gonna eat our lunch.\r\nIn early 2001, a 26-year-old entrepreneur named Ric Fulop started knocking on doors at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, hoping to find someone to help him start a battery company. One of the people who answered was Yet-Ming Chiang, a professor of materials science, who invited his friend with a doctorate from Cornell University, Bart Riley, to meet with them regularly. They narrowed in on Chiangs idea for a self-assembling battery. Batteries have three basic components: two electrodes a cathode and an anode that store and release a charge, and an electrolyte that helps shuttle the charge between them. The materials used to make batteries determine how much energy they store and at what cost. Chiangs dream was to find three materials that would, under the right conditions, fall into the exact structure of a battery.\r\nThat summer they hatched A123, and soon raised $8 million, along with recruiting Vieau, an executive from a Rhode Island power equipment company, to be CEO. But six months in, the team realized that making the self-assembling battery a reality would take a long time. Meanwhile, Chiangs lab was publishing science papers on LFP as a superior material, and he convinced Vieau that A123 could use it to pursue a commercial battery instead.\r\nLFP was discovered by a team of researchers led by professor John Goodenough in 1995. Goodenough, who would\u00a0win the Nobel Prize decades later, had given his lab researchers at UT Austin an assignment: Take a lithium-ion battery cell and swap out different metals to see if they can hold more energy without catching fire, as journalist Steve LeVine chronicles in his book \"The Powerhouse,\" which profiles the pioneers of modern battery chemistry. Goodenoughs team chose an iron-and-phosphorous compound and made a test cell. When they charged it, the compound formed an atomic crystal structure\u00a0that easily shuttled lithium ions back and forth. They had stumbled onto a new cathode material, one that would prove to be cheaper and more stable than existing technology.\r\nInitially, LFP batteries were slow to charge and discharge. Scientists affiliated with a Canadian electric utility company solved that by coating LFP cathode particles with carbon, an innovation that could make the material commercially viable. Around the same time, A123s Chiang published an\u00a0article in the scientific journal\u00a0Nature Materials, stating that doping an LFP cathode, or injecting tiny amounts of metallic compounds, including an element called niobium, helped electrons travel faster so the battery could produce even more instantaneous power. This discovery, which A123 would later brand Nanophosphate, became the companys key innovation, enabling batteries to produce two or three times more immediate power than any other similarly sized cell on the market.\r\nPresident Barack Obama awards the National Medal of Science to Dr. John Goodenough of the University of Texas, in 2013. (AP)\r\nIndustrial espionage\r\nIt didnt take long for A123 to find applications for Nanophosphate. Within a few years, the startup secured a contract with Stanley Black &amp; Decker Inc. to provide batteries for a new line of power tools and raised another $32 million. Staring down an 18-month deadline with limited cash, A123 decided to outsource to lower-cost countries. They hired a company in Taiwan to make electrodes and cells, later shifting the electrode work to Korea. China, racing to match the electronic manufacturing prowess of its neighbors, was also eager to accommodate the U.S. startup. A123 built its cathode plant in a low-tax economic processing zone outside Shanghai, set up by the Chinese government to help foreign companies lower production costs while creating local jobs.\r\nDespite the financial perks, intellectual property theft was a constant concern. A123 executives visiting from the U.S. would return to their hotel rooms to find screws loose on their laptops. A staffer at A123s offices in Changzhou found an envelope in the outgoing mail basket addressed to a competitor. They opened it to find blueprints of the cathode operation, along with the r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of an A123 production engineer, who was promptly fired.\r\nTo protect A123s proprietary LFP cathode powder, the factory was divided into two buildings with limited access so no single Chinese employee could see the entire process. Larry Beck, a chemistry professor at the University of Michigan who became A123s lead cathode materials scientist, rented a building behind a scrap metal yard and turned it into a low-profile chemistry lab, plucking iron from the heaps of sheetmetal and dissolving it in acid to produce purified crystals needed to make LFP.\r\nAs the Chinese government nurtured a domestic EV industry by converting city bus fleets and offering tax breaks for EV purchases, local entrepreneurs emerged to capitalize on state support.\u00a0Zeng Yuqun, now the 41st richest person in the world according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, founded CATL in 2011 while running a company that made batteries for consumer electronics. CATL cut its automotive teeth producing cells for\u00a0BMW AG\u00a0and its local Chinese partner and would later recruit engineers from the West to sharpen its manufacturing skills. My job as an older guy was to apply experiential learning so they could learn faster, says Bob Galyen, an American battery engineer Zeng hired in 2012 who later became CATLs chief technology officer.\r\nCATL wasnt the only juggernaut to emerge\u00a0from Chinas EV push.\u00a0BYD Co., which is already outselling\u00a0Tesla Inc.\u00a0with its combined EV and hybrid models, also started out making batteries for cellphones. Its founder, a chemist named Wang Chuanfu, bought a car company in 2003. Five years later, at the Beijing auto show, BYD introduced the E6, an EV with an LFP battery that could go 186 miles on a single charge. Today, its Han sedan, with its own BYD-made battery, can go 410 miles.\r\nPresident Bush listens to Dave Vieau, president and chief executive officer of A123 Systems, as he is shown a plug-in hybrid vehicle utilizing a lithium power battery on the South Lawn of the White House in 2007. (Tribune News Service via Getty Images)\r\nA123 and automotive\r\nAs Chinese entrepreneurs built companies that would turn the Communist Partys EV dreams into reality, executives at A123 were riding their own wave of electric euphoria. The performance of the A123-powered Black &amp; Decker drill had attracted other potential customers. Gillette Co. wanted to put A123s batteries in electric razors.\u00a0Mattel Inc.\u00a0wanted them for high-end toys. But Fulop, then vice president of business development, knew that to take on Asian battery giants, A123 needed to move into cars. In January 2008 he called Mujeeb Ijaz, an engineer who was running Fords EV skunkworks in Dearborn, Michigan.\r\nWhen Ijaz got the call from Fulop inviting him to lunch, the engineer was still reeling from the news from his bosses. A year earlier, Ford had unveiled his breakthrough: the Edge, a plug-in hybrid SUV that ran on hydrogen and battery power. Now, as the Big Three girded for a recession, he was told Ford was cutting off funding for his department.\r\nIjaz could get reassigned to another group within Ford after all, hed been with the company for 15 years. But he was intrigued by Fulops proposition; working on batteries was something hed always seemed destined for. The son of Pakistani immigrants a nuclear physicist and a solar panel entrepreneurIjaz was born and raised in Virginia, where his father was a professor at Virginia Tech and his mother graduated from the school with two doctorates. Dinner table conversation often revolved around the 1970s oil embargo and how energy access was at the root of global conflict. After participating in a General Motors-sponsored solar-car race as a college student, he was hooked.\r\nWithin a week of Fulops call, Ijaz was leading A123s automotive business, and several members of his Ford team soon joined him. The startup already had deals to build prototypes for BMW and\u00a0Daimler Truck AG, and it was competing against\u00a0LG Chem Inc.\u00a0to supply batteries for the Chevy Volt, GMs new hybrid sedan. Chrysler had a new electric car division, and A123 was vying to become its supplier, too.\r\nAs the economy crumbled in late 2008, everything started to align for A123. Four months after President George W. Bush agreed to throw GM and Chrysler a lifeline, Chrysler executives announced they would build an EV lineup with A123 batteries. By June 2009 the federal government had taken ownership stakes in GM and Chrysler, and Obama sought to pump hundreds of billions of dollars of stimulus money into the economy. A123 won a piece: a $249 million grant from the U.S. Department of Energy to support construction of two manufacturing facilities in Michigan. That government backing, along with the Chrysler EV deal, helped propel A123s $380 million initial public offering that September. The startup wasnt profitable, but it was in promising talks with automakers in China, Europe and the U.S., and now had enough money to invest in high-volume battery production, giving it the chops to compete with global manufacturers.\r\nChrysler EV division concepts at the 2008 L.A. Auto Show. (Reuters)\r\nSetbacks and Sergio Marchionne\r\nBut it didnt take long for A123s bet on EVs to start looking shaky. Sergio Marchionne, CEO of the Italian car company Fiat Automobiles SpA, had taken Chrysler off the U.S. governments hands at a hefty discount, with a promise to make small, fuel-efficient cars. Marchionne was a master negotiator and strategist who would bring Chrysler back from the dead, but he was not a fan of electric cars. By late summer 2009 he shut down Chryslers EV division. Vieau, A123s CEO, still held out hope that a program to bring an electric Fiat 500 minicar to the US would survive. It did, but despite the public declarations and almost two years of development work, Chrysler awarded the production contract to Samsung Electronics Co.\u00a0and\u00a0Robert Bosch GmbH, a global supplier with whom it had existing contracts.\r\nWithout Chrysler or GM which went with LG on the Chevy Volt A123 had to scramble. Its new plants were set to open in September 2010, and it pieced together enough business to keep its Michigan factories humming. It had a deal to start making batteries for stationary power grids, a small contract with the U.S. Department of Defense and a joint venture with a Chinese car company. GM agreed to use its batteries for the electric version of the compact Chevy Spark. The companys business prospects looked decent, but its survival was contingent on EV sales taking off. (Around this time, it also settled a years-long legal battle with some LFP patent holders who accused the company of copying their carbon-coating process.)\r\nThen, in March 2012, A123 ran into a problem. It was under contract to build battery packs for the Fisker Karma plug-in hybrid, a $100,000 sedan created by famous Aston Martin designer Henrik Fisker. During a test drive for\u00a0Consumer Reports\u00a0magazine, a Fisker Karma abruptly shut down. Ijaz, now A123s vice president for cell engineering, was dispatched to the factory to investigate. He traced the issue to a handful of pouchlike cells that hadnt been sealed properly, allowing electrolyte fluid to leak out, which could cause an electrical short. The Fisker Karmas battery management system, sensing the problem, was shutting down as a safety measure.\r\nOut of an abundance of caution, and perhaps a fear of litigation, Vieau decided to publicly disclose the problem and issue a full recall and replacement of all battery packs shipped to Fisker. It would be painful, but he hoped the recall would burnish A123s reputation as an honest supplier. Instead, it tipped the company over a cliff.\r\nWith product quality in doubt, financing for A123s other projects dried up. The recall cost much less than feared and never triggered a battery fire, but it didnt matter. Fisker, a key customer, was in turmoil. In Washington, Obamas clean energy agenda was taking a beating after Solyndra filed for bankruptcy in September. The 2012 presidential election was less than a year away, and Republicans made sure to turn the administrations flailing bets into a handy rhetorical prop. A123 was decried as a loser, along with Tesla, which had received a $465 million loan from the DOE. Vieau appealed to the White House for a lifeline and was rebuffed. The response was essentially, We did our part youre on your own now, he recalls. Seven months after the defective Fisker batteries were discovered, and a decade after its founding, A123 filed for bankruptcy.\r\nWanxiang Innovative Energy City under construction in Hangzhou, east China's Zhejiang Province, in 2023. (Getty Images)\r\nChina swoops in\r\nA123 turned to\u00a0Johnson Controls Inc., a Milwaukee-based auto supplier with its own battery business, to open the bidding for its assets, but Johnson Controls and its partners were outbid by Chinese auto parts giant Wanxiang. Several congressional Republicans objected to the idea of a taxpayer-funded tech startup going to a foreign company, but A123s creditors wanted whoever could offer the most money.\r\nThe acquisition still had to be approved by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, an interagency group led by the Department of the Treasury that reviews mergers and acquisitions for national security concerns. As CFIUS analyzed the deal, Admiral Dennis Blair, a retired U.S. Navy commander and former director of national intelligence under Obama, reviewed the transaction. On Dec. 20, 2012, Blair published an op-ed in Politico\u00a0supporting Wanxiangs bid, as long as CFIUS found no fault. He urged policymakers to recognize the importance of allowing the deal for both national security and international commerce. There are many sensitive technologies that the United States should protect, Blair wrote. The manufacture of lithium-ion batteries is not one of them.\r\nAlmost all of A123s assets, patents and technology breakthroughs went to China after the sale as, briefly, did Ijaz. Wanxiangs own battery business was rolled up under the A123 name, and the new A123 pivoted from focusing on pure electric and hybrid vehicles to batteries for engines that shut off at stoplights to save gas. Ijaz was named CTO and visited Wanxiangs headquarters in Hangzhou.\r\nOur Next Energy (ONE) CEO Mujeeb Ijaz with the company's Aries lithium iron phosphate battery packs at ONE's headquarters in Novi, Michigan in 2022.

Wanxiang says it wanted Ijaz to kick the tires on the prospective supplier to protect A123s intellectual property and also its own commercial interests. The secret of A123s cathode powder was not only the list of ingredients but also how they were processed. It required special mixing equipment and magnetic filters to remove contaminants. Using the wrong length of pipe or type of machinery could throw off the whole batch. As Ijaz toured the suppliers factory, he noticed the process looked familiar very familiar.\r\nIjaz finally came out and asked the new supplier if he was using A123s blueprints. To his surprise, the man retrieved a three-ring binder with his mugshot from when hed been arrested for IP theft. It had all been a big misunderstanding, he said. Intellectual property rights were loosely enforced in China at the time, and some judges were inclined to favor Chinese companies. The governments 10-year plan to dominate the EV industry was in full swing; to start a battery company was to heed a collectivist call for a new national industry. Instead of punishing him, the Chinese government had provided subsidies to help him build his own business. The man began thanking Ijaz profusely. A123 had changed his life, he said.\r\nWhen the visit was over, the owner took Ijaz out to his car and popped the trunk. He wanted to give him a gift as a token of thanks. It was bedsheets the weirdest damn gift with horses on them, Ijaz recalls. I found out, before he had come into A123s IP, he had a bedsheet factory.\r\nIjaz stayed at A123 for another year before leaving in 2014 to work on\u00a0Apple Inc.s secretive electric-car project. Six years later, while in pandemic lockdown with his wife and grown kids in Los Altos, California, he began thinking about the three barriers to mass EV adoption: Until batteries could go further on a single charge, range anxiety would persist; lithium-ion batteries with nickel in them were more prone to catch fire; and America still didnt have a homegrown battery giant to compete with CATL, LG and Panasonic. If Ijaz could hatch a company that focused on LFP batteries cheaper and more stable than the nickel-based ones dominant in the West he could solve all three problems.\r\nONE could be the one\r\nBy July 2020, Ijaz left Apple and founded\u00a0Our Next Energy, dubbed ONE for short. In many ways he was picking up where A123 left off. He moved back to Michigan, his startup office in the suburbs of Detroit standing only a mile away from A123s current U.S. engineering center. Almost a sixth of ONEs 315-person staff are A123 alumni, including the chief operating officer. Ijazs goal at the moment: trying to improve LFP batteries range, something CATL and BYD have been trying to crack with legions of battery scientists and a decade of high-volume manufacturing experience. So far, ONE has designed a streamlined battery pack that has the same size and energy specs as a nickel-cobalt battery, without the higher price and spotty human-rights record. A more ambitious product, called Gemini, aims to deliver 700 miles of range to passenger cars double the 350 miles a long-range Tesla Model S offers.\r\nThe early excitement about ONE is eerily familiar. Its raised $355 million from investors including Bill Gatess Breakthrough Energy Ventures LLC, BMW i Ventures Inc. and Franklin Templeton, with a valuation of $1.2 billion. Last fall the state of Michigan awarded it at least $220 million in cash and tax breaks to build a\u00a0$1.6 billion cell manufacturing plant\u00a0in the Detroit suburbs, where it plans to hire 2,100 people after it starts production in 2024.\r\nFormer House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Michigans Democratic Governor Gretchen Whitmer have visited ONEs offices, as have members of the states congressional delegation. With the Inflation Reduction Act, the federal government will pay ONE as much as $6,500 for every 105-kilowatt-hour battery pack the startup produces in Michigan. The IRA is also creating incentives for car companies to do business with ONE, thanks to rules West Virginias Democratic Senator Joe Manchin inserted that require batteries be made in North America, with raw materials sourced domestically or from U.S. allies, to qualify for consumer EV credits. If there was ever a poster child for what Biden is trying to achieve with his climate bill, ONE is it.\r\nAfter more than three decades in the industry, Ijaz, now 56, finally seems to have momentum on his side. Detroit and the rest of the global auto industry are all-in on EVs, even if its out of desperation. Western carmakers who dragged their feet are now losing share in China. Tesla proved Americans will buy EVs, and Ford and GM have introduced hit products such as the Mustang Mach-E and Cadillac Lyriq. Electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles are forecast to make up about half of U.S. new-car sales by the end of the decade, compared with a share in the high single digits last year.\r\nBut there are no guarantees that a gambit to spur an American battery champion will work. ONEs success may depend as much on its founders tenacity as on Americas overcoming its tendency to get in its own way. In the risky, low-margin battery business, a single manufacturing defect as Ijaz experienced with A123 can be lethal for a startup. CATL, LG and the worlds other battery giants have major backing in the form of government subsidies or a gigantic conglomerate behind them. Thats why LG was able to absorb a $1.9 billion hit\u00a0for the Chevy Bolt battery recall in 2021 and keep on ticking.\r\nWas anything learned?\r\nEven though the national security threats posed by China seem like one of the few areas of bipartisan agreement left in Washington these days, the idea of government taking a more muscular role in commercializing technology doesnt sit well with many Americans. In a replay of 2012, Republicans in Congress are already taking aim at Bidens clean energy agenda as a waste of taxpayer money and a misguided attempt to pick winners and losers. They argue that the price tag for the IRA seems grossly underestimated, and theyre scrutinizing Energy Department loan recipients to find the next Solyndra.\r\nAnd for all the fury over Chinas brazen plunder of American intellectual property, the consequences of our unchecked outsourcing dont attract nearly as much political scrutiny. All these years later, its still unclear who had access to the spoils of the A123 IP or how widely they were shared. But there are still traces of A123s technology inside Chinas vast battery supply chain. One of the top suppliers of LFP cathode material in the world today,\u00a0Hubei Wanrun New Energy Technology Co., started out as a supplier to A123 in Changzhou. Beck, the A123 materials scientist who worked closely with the company to develop battery-grade iron phosphate material, says Wanrun was an honorable partner. After the bankruptcy, though, the Chinese upstart was freed of any nondisclosure agreements. Meanwhile, CATL and BYD, which havent been accused of infringement by A123, invested billions in capital to create the scale and cost efficiencies they have today. (CATL and BYD declined to comment. Wanxiang says its operations of A123 have been run in a manner not detrimental or damaging to the U.S. battery industry nor the Sino-U.S. relationship.)\r\nThe U.S. has long thought of itself as an innovation machine powered by the virtues of shareholder capitalism. We stick with this belief, largely oblivious to emerging evidence that while free markets beat planned economies, there may be room for a modification that is even better, wrote Andy Grove, legendary CEO and co-founder of Intel Corp., in this magazine 13 years ago. If the U.S. neglects to alter its industrial policy, he warned at the time, it will fall behind in every technological revolution. If what Im suggesting sounds protectionist, he wrote, so be it.\r\nIjaz has been watching the repercussions of this inaction unfold for years, ever since his first trip to China in 2007 to show off his plug-in hybrid Ford Edge. Back then, it was a new battery technology never seen before in China. Now, China controls the means to make it.\r\nEven if the U.S. does stay the course, Ijaz concedes, it wont be enough to compete on EVs. Chinese companies, already pushing into new markets in Europe and South America, can lower costs by achieving scale faster than anyone. Even if Ford, his former employer, wanted to tap a homegrown supplier such as ONE instead of a Chinese behemoth like CATL, its simply not realistic yet. The car company, just like most major car companies, is under the gun to pump out EVs, and its already desperately behind. It doesnt have the luxury of waiting for Ijazs young startup to get its footing.\r\nThe amount of money that were putting in is better than Ive ever seen before, and the IRA is a better step than Ive ever seen before. With the right policy and the right decision, we can move the needle here, Ijaz says. But, boy, is it gonna take a lot more than what were doing.",

        "full_text": "We feel now is a pretty good time to analyse Heliogen, Inc.'s (NYSE:HLGN) business as it appears the company may be on the cusp of a considerable accomplishment. Heliogen, Inc., a renewable energy technology company, operates in decarbonizing industry with concentrated sunlight. The US$46m market-cap companys loss lessened since it announced a US$142m loss in the full financial year, compared to the latest trailing-twelve-month loss of US$94m, as it approaches breakeven. Many investors are wondering about the rate at which Heliogen will turn a profit, with the big question being when will the company breakeven? We've put together a brief outline of industry analyst expectations for the company, its year of breakeven and its implied growth rate.\r\n View our latest analysis for Heliogen \r\nAccording to the 3 industry analysts covering Heliogen, the consensus is that breakeven is near. They anticipate the company to incur a final loss in 2024, before generating positive profits of US$14m in 2025. Therefore, the company is expected to breakeven roughly 2 years from now. In order to meet this breakeven date, we calculated the rate at which the company must grow year-on-year. It turns out an average annual growth rate of 59% is expected, which is extremely buoyant. If this rate turns out to be too aggressive, the company may become profitable much later than analysts predict.\r\nearnings-per-share-growth\r\nGiven this is a high-level overview, we wont go into details of Heliogen's upcoming projects, though, keep in mind that generally a high forecast growth rate is not unusual for a company that is currently undergoing an investment period.\r\nBefore we wrap up, theres one aspect worth mentioning. Heliogen currently has no debt on its balance sheet, which is quite unusual for a cash-burning growth company, which typically has high debt relative to its equity. The company currently operates purely off its shareholder funding and has no debt obligation, reducing concerns around repayments and making it a less risky investment.\r\nThere are key fundamentals of Heliogen which are not covered in this article, but we must stress again that this is merely a basic overview. For a more comprehensive look at Heliogen, take a look at Heliogen's company page on Simply Wall St. We've also compiled a list of pertinent factors you should look at:\r\n<ol><li>Valuation: What is Heliogen worth today?

Dislike is where the dividend money is at!\r\nAnalyst ratings are a wonderful buy signal. Vanilla investors purchase payers that are widely likedand wonder why every downgrade dents their pocketbook.\r\nWe dont care about popularity. Heck, we prefer stocks that are far from being in analyst good graces.\r\nGive us the disgraces. And well collect our dividends while we sit back and wait for the analyst upgrades to follow.\r\nIts not easy to find the uncool kids on Wall Street. The school of S&amp;P 500 is a joke. Everyone gets an award (a Buy rating):\r\nAnalyst Ratings S&amp;P 500\r\nS&amp;P Global Market Intelligence\r\nFour in five stocks are buys. What a market!\r\nLets consider the discarded one in five, my fellow contrarian. Today I have handpicked eight loathed dividend payers dishing between 5.9% and 18.3% annually. Hated for a reason? Perhapsor perhaps not.\r\nMoelis &amp; Co. (MC)\r\nWe start with independent global investment bank Moelis &amp; Co. (MC, 5.9% yield), which provides numerous advisory services, most notably in mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A).\r\nMoelis has nary a buy to its name following a 2022 that saw M&amp;A activity fall off a cliff. The situation hasnt improved much in 2023the banking crisis has further muddied the M&amp;A watersand Moelis is just a month or so removed from another earnings miss. In the short-term, things could get even worse for MC than they already are. But keep your eye on Moelis longer-term, as robust hiring in its tech arm could represent the underpinnings of future growth.\r\nXerox (XRX)\r\nOne of the biggest names in printing continues to fight for relevancy.\r\nXerox (XRX, 6.6% yield) sells printers and digital document services in more than 160 countries nationwide. The latter business makes sense in the modern officethe former, less so. Xerox already was facing reduced paperwork heading into the COVID office exodus. And while employers are pushing for a return to the workplace, its clear that hybrid situations are here to staymeaning overall less demand for Xeroxs core products.\r\nXRX is also friendless in the analyst crowd, with zero buys at present. Thats despite a yield of nearly 7% and an extremely cheap valuation: its price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio is a lowly 0.6. But I think the pros are right hereXerox might be cheap, but its not a value.\r\nEnergy Stocks\r\nCrudes slowdown in 2023 has taken energy stocks with it, saddling the sector with a loss despite an up year for the broader market.\r\nTexas-based CVR Energy (CVI, 7.5% yield) deals in renewable fuels and petroleum refining, as well as nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing through its interest in CVR Partners LP (UAN). It hacked its payout in half during COVIDnot abnormal for the space. However, while CVI did begin to restore it this year, theres not much room for celebration. Last years massive special dividends seem unlikely to repeat unless oil goes bananas again, based on comments from CVR Energys Q1 conference call. But more importantly from that same call: A spinoff of their UAN stake could warrant a review of their regular dividend. Analysts bearishness seems deserved here.\r\nHolly Energy Partners LP (HEP, 7.8% yield) has a single buy call, but that lone wolf might have the right idea. HEP, formed in 2004 by HollyFrontiernow HF Sinclair (DINO)provides petroleum product and crude oil transportation, terminalling, storage and throughput storage. The companys recent results have been boosted by HollyFrontiers acquisition of Sinclair, as well as higher revenues on its Woods Cross refinery processing units. This newfound tailwind should widen its dividend coverageraising the prospects of a distribution raise, which would begin a long climb back from a near-halving of the payout in 2020.\r\nCheniere Energy Partners LP (CQP, 9.4% yield) is another unpopular master limited partnership (MLP), boasting just two buy calls against six holds and six sells. It was created by Cheniere Energy (LNG) to hold its midstream assets; it owns Louisianas Sabine Pass liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal, as well as the Creole Trail Pipeline.\r\nCQP has been a perpetual quarterly distribution raiser for yearssmall steps each quarter, but steps that have added up over time. That said, the MLP came up against a brick wall this year, as it actually announced a ~4% decrease in May. Regardless, the companys full-year guidance of $4.00-$4.25 per unit would be an improvement over 2022. My concern: CQP is starting an expensive Sabine Pass expansionone that could draw resources away from the distribution as early as next year.\r\nREITs\r\nWall Street is generally disenchanted with real estate investment trusts (REITs) right now, and for good reason. Jerome Powells lead foot has kept the interest-rate pedal down, rattling the sector loose. Real estate has underperformed since the start of the bear market, and is still flat in 2023 against a 12% gain for stocks more broadly.\r\nIn short: There are plenty of hated stocks in the space. But are there any you can trust?\r\nLTC Properties (LTC, 6.8% yield) invests in a 50/50 blend of senior housing and skilled nursing properties from coast to coast. While the worst of COVID has long passed, the operating environment remains difficult for LTC. After the end of Q1, LTC allowed one tenant to defer interest payments, another to defer monthly rent, and a third will receive an abatement. Long-term, theres no denying the importance and stickiness of these kinds of properties, but theres little in the way of short-term catalysts.\r\nAn even more troubled area of real estate is office property. Take Office Properties Income Trust (OPI, 12.2% yield), for instance. It owns nearly 160 primarily single-tenant office properties across the U.S. Shares are off nearly two-thirds over the past year and now trade in the single digits. Work-from-home would seem to doom the likes of OPI, though the REIT is an outlier operationally: Most of its properties are suburb-based, not city-based, and its occupancy rate is north of 96%. Still, Ive largely agreed with the bearish analyst campIve recommended avoiding OPI in the past, and readers who heeded that advice dodged a 55% dividend cut announced in April.\r\nMost analysts are on the fence concerning Hudson Pacific Properties (HPP, 18.3% yield). HPP leases out office and studio properties up and down the West Coast, from L.A. all the way up to Vancouver. Hudsons office issues mirror the rest, but in March, I also flagged the potential hit from Hollywoods writers strike. Well, in May, the company withdrew its full-year FFO outlook thanks to uncertainty from the strikeand more importantly, waved a white flag for its dividend. The Companys Board of Directors approved a 40% to 50% reduction in the common stock dividend, with the exact amount to be determined later this month. That exact amount hasnt yet been announced, but even halving the dividend would leave behind a yield in the high single digits, and a much healthier payout ratio of roughly half of first-quarter adjusted funds from operations (AFFO).\r\nBrett Owens is chief investment strategist for Contrarian Outlook.

        "full_text": "Outlook Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:OTLK) is possibly approaching a major achievement in its business, so we would like to shine some light on the company. Outlook Therapeutics, Inc., a late clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company, focuses on developing and commercializing monoclonal antibodies for various ophthalmic indications. The US$444m market-cap companys loss lessened since it announced a US$66m loss in the full financial year, compared to the latest trailing-twelve-month loss of US$57m, as it approaches breakeven. The most pressing concern for investors is Outlook Therapeutics' path to profitability when will it breakeven? Below we will provide a high-level summary of the industry analysts expectations for the company.\r\n View our latest analysis for Outlook Therapeutics \r\nConsensus from 7 of the American Biotechs analysts is that Outlook Therapeutics is on the verge of breakeven. They expect the company to post a final loss in 2024, before turning a profit of US$124m in 2025. Therefore, the company is expected to breakeven roughly 2 years from now. In order to meet this breakeven date, we calculated the rate at which the company must grow year-on-year. It turns out an average annual growth rate of 64% is expected, which is extremely buoyant. Should the business grow at a slower rate, it will become profitable at a later date than expected.\r\nearnings-per-share-growth\r\nUnderlying developments driving Outlook Therapeutics' growth isnt the focus of this broad overview, but, take into account that typically biotechs, depending on the stage of product development, have irregular periods of cash flow. So, a high growth rate is not out of the ordinary, particularly when a company is in a period of investment.\r\nOne thing we would like to bring into light with Outlook Therapeutics is its debt-to-equity ratio of over 2x. Typically, debt shouldnt exceed 40% of your equity, and the company has considerably exceeded this. Note that a higher debt obligation increases the risk around investing in the loss-making company.\r\nThere are too many aspects of Outlook Therapeutics to cover in one brief article, but the key fundamentals for the company can all be found in one place Outlook Therapeutics' company page on Simply Wall St. We've also put together a list of key aspects you should further examine:\r\n<ol><li>Valuation: What is Outlook Therapeutics worth today?

        "file_name": "2023-06-11_62359868.txt",
        "full_text": "Comment on this story\r\nComment\r\nTexas state Rep. Kronda Thimesch repeatedly heard her daughter cry as the college student tried to buy tickets last fall to see one of her favorite artists, Taylor Swift. Every time she made it to the final checkout phase on Ticketmasters website, the tickets just disappeared.\r\nMany of Thimeschs constituents were similarly disappointed, flooding her inbox and social media channels after the website buckled under what Ticketmaster called unprecedented demand to see the megastars Eras Tour.\r\nMy daughter told me, Theres nothing we can do about it. This is wrong, the Republican legislator told The Washington Post. I said, Actually, we can.\r\nAcross the country, lawmakers are introducing bills aimed at avoiding a repeat of the November Ticketmaster meltdown, in which many of Swifts fans tried and failed to buy tickets. The incident sparked waves of ire among Swift fans and policymakers alike, reigniting a debate over whether the companys outsize market dominance is failing consumers.\r\nIn May, Gov. Greg Abbott (R) signed into law the Save Our Swifties Act, introduced by Thimesch, imposing fines on scalpers who use bots to hoard tickets. Last year, New York state enacted a measure to crack down on scalping and control the ticket-resale market. In Minnesota, H.F. 1989 a reference to Swifts fifth studio album would require Ticketmaster and other companies to include their fees in prices upfront. And in Washington state, lawmakers are considering a bill aimed at regulating the secondary ticket market and stabilizing ticket prices.\r\nAnd thats only at the state level. Sens. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) and Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) have introduced a bill that would put federal regulatory scrutiny on the long-term contracts that Ticketmaster holds with concert venues an issue raised during a January Senate hearing in which lawmakers on both sides grilled a top company official.\r\nMeanwhile, Sens. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) and Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.) introduced a price transparency bill in April, and Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.) has proposed transparency and scalping reforms.\r\nIn the House, New Jersey Democratic Reps. Bill Pascrell Jr. and Frank Pallone Jr. have introduced the Boss and Swift Act (a nod to Bruce Springsteen), which seeks to enhance ticket-pricing transparency by updating legislation first introduced in 2009. A separate House bill, which President Biden hyped in his State of the Union address, takes aim at fees tacked on to ticket sales.\r\nIn the past, lawmakers and musicians have attempted to challenge Ticketmasters dominance, without much success. Pearl Jam boycotted the company in the 1990s and, despite some political momentum, largely failed to force big changes. Last August, Bruce Springsteen fans were shocked when ticket prices surged in some cases to $5,000. But the Swift Ticketmaster debacle, amplified by a mass of concertgoers who flocked to social media to vent, has given the issue new life, industry experts said.\r\nAnother major factor in the recent momentum: Swifts star power.\r\nSwifts most recent album, Midnights broke industry records with its release in October, dominating the top of the Billboard Hot 100 chart and becoming the most-streamed album in the first 24 hours of release on Spotify. More than 2 million tickets for the tour were sold the day of the Eras Tour rollout, the most ever in a single day, according to Ticketmaster.\r\nIts a lot of things that have to do with Taylor Swift, said Carolyn Sloane, an assistant professor of economics of the University of California at Riverside, on why this particular event spurred mass action.\r\nShe scaled her talent through demographic technology, Sloane continued. She got to her fans when they were very young, and she stuck with them. And then they went out into the world and made a case for how great she was to their parents and friends and everybody.\r\nThat group includes officials at the highest levels of the federal government, such as a bipartisan group of U.S. senators who repeatedly invoked Swift lyrics at a January hearing in which they questioned a panel about Ticketmasters dominance in the live events industry, as well as state lawmakers who responded to the ticketing crash with legislation named after the superstar.\r\nIn the case of the Save our Swifties law, for example, a penalty of up to $10,000 per violation would be imposed on scalpers who use bots to snap up tickets en masse. The measure, which will take effect in September, was supported by Ticketmaster and other ticketing agencies, Thimesch, the Texas Republican, said.\r\nIn Washington state, Rep. Kristine Reeves (D) introduced in January the TSWIFT Consumer Protection Act, which proposes limits on ticket resellers and expands the prohibition of using bots or software to buy tickets. The bill also proposed restrictions on dynamic pricing, which refers to price fluctuations based on demand.\r\nNotably, that proposal didnt receive the same support from Ticketmaster and other companies, Reeves said.\r\nTicketmaster was being helpful in Texas was because Texas was doing something in favor of Ticketmaster, Reeves said. Where Ticketmaster and I couldnt see eye-to-eye was the fact that we were trying to regulate them more broadly and with more standards.\r\nAfter months of talks with Ticketmaster and industry lobbyists, Reeves paused her effort out of frustration. She hopes to redraft the measure in the next legislative session, months after Swifts Seattle tour date.\r\nIt became clear very quickly that [Ticketmaster was] hiring major lobbyists essentially to kill my bill, she said.\r\nIn a statement to The Post, Ticketmaster did not specifically address those negotiations, but noted that it has had to ramp up our engagement with policymakers because they are being inundated with misinformation peddled by scalpers.\r\nSome of the recently introduced legislation includes language pushed by pro-scalping groups, such as measures that would explicitly preserve the right of consumers to resell tickets, Ticketmaster added. But it said it does support some of the new measures, including fines against scalpers who use bots, as well as all-in pricing.\r\nWere very hopeful the added attention on ticketing will help pass common sense reforms, and we want to be part of the solution, Ticketmaster added.\r\nA core issue, according to Eric Budish, an economics and entrepreneurship professor at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, is whether popular artists such as Swift can restrict ticket resales as a way to deter scalpers and bots.\r\nIt will be hard to fix the problems with the event ticket market if artists like Swift cant do that, explained Budish.\r\nAn even more fundamental question is whether Ticketmaster has become a monopoly a charge it has long denied.\r\nThe company has steadily grown to dominate the industry since establishing its website in the 1990s, and it gained even greater power in 2010 when it merged with Live Nation Entertainment, a top show promoter. Regulators waved through the deal under a set of terms that, among other things, prohibited the company from retaliating against concert venues for using a ticketing company other than Ticketmaster.\r\nStill, the merger allowed the company to control two major parts of the live events industry show promotion and ticket sales which critics have zeroed in on. Artists and other promoters allege the company has used these dual roles to force venues and artists to use only its services, which the company has denied.\r\nThe Justice Department took action in 2019, alleging that Live Nation had violated the terms of its merger, including threatening concert venues. The company agreed to clarify those terms in a settlement.\r\nBut Live Nation and Ticketmaster have been unable to shake the monopoly charge.\r\nThe U.S. ticketing industry has never been more competitive than it is today, both within primary ticketing and the enormous secondary market, Ticketmaster told The Post. There is intense bidding competition for every ticketing contract, and this has resulted in venues and teams receiving more of the economic value in a ticketing contract while ticketing companies such as Ticketmaster receive less.\r\nLive Nation told The Post that since the merger, Ticketmasters market share has gone down, not up.\r\nWhat is clear is that Ticketmaster is far larger than its competitors. In 2022, it sold more than 550 million tickets and reported more than $16 billion in annual revenue. By contrast, Eventbrite, another publicly traded ticket seller, sold just over 87 million tickets and reported nearly $261 million in annual revenue.\r\nThe debate erupted again last November, when the turbulent rollout of Swifts Eras Tour tickets enraged fans. Would-be concertgoers reported waiting in frozen queues and broken checkouts on Ticketmasters website, and many said they emerged empty-handed.\r\nTicketmaster blamed overwhelming demand and a staggering number of bot attacks for its websites meltdown. But critics said the company should have been prepared, with some pointing to the failure as evidence that Ticketmaster had grown too large and should be broken up. A group of fans sued the company under California unfair competition laws, saying it messed with the wrong fan base. Swift voiced her own frustrations and likened her fans experiences to going through several bear attacks.\r\nNow, policymakers are proposing fixes, and industry experts and even Ticketmaster say some might actually make a difference.\r\nSloane, the assistant professor at UC Riverside, says the New Yorkbill might be the most honest attempt at trying to get at some of these issues. It imposes penalties on scalpers who use bots and places limits on reselling holdback tickets, which are distributed to artists, promoters and venues and are not offered on the primary market. Both measures, Sloane notes, could boost supply.\r\nThe measure also requires companies to include the extra fees in prices before tickets are selected so customers are not surprised. Those surcharges can total an estimated 27 percent of the ticket price, according to a 2018 report by the Government Accountability Office.\r\nWhile Gov. Kathy Hochul (D) signed the bill in June of 2022, months before the Swift ticketing meltdown, it was never put to the test because Swifts tour did not pass through New York, Sloane noted. All-in pricing has made its way into some of the state bills, however.\r\nSloane also points to the Senate bill introduced by Klobuchar and Blumenthal, which takes another tack by trying to increase competition. If enacted, it would effectively limit the long-term, exclusive contracts that Ticketmaster holds with large venues to four years, opening up opportunities for competitors. That could lead to lower prices for consumers.\r\nFlorian Ederer, an associate professor of economics at the Yale School of Management, calls the proposals for all-in pricing the most reasonable with a high chance of success.\r\nThere is good empirical evidence that this type of re-pricing harms consumers,Ederer said, adding that any all-in pricing measures could change that.\r\nFor her part, Klobuchar said she was less concerned about the most recent Swift conflagration and more focused on the long-running issue of alleged monopoly and the costs it forces onconsumers.\r\nDo I care that her fans were up in arms? No, Klobuchar told The Post. But she wants to use the spotlight cast by her fans to seize the moment.\r\nWith that kind of attention, she said, Ticketmaster cant live in the shadows.",

        "file_name": "2023-06-11_62359867.txt",
        "full_text": "Comment on this story\r\nComment\r\nTexas state Rep. Kronda Thimesch repeatedly heard her daughter cry as the college student tried to buy tickets last fall to see one of her favorite artists, Taylor Swift. Every time she made it to the final checkout phase on Ticketmasters website, the tickets just disappeared.\r\nMany of Thimeschs constituents were similarly disappointed, flooding her inbox and social media channels after the website buckled under what Ticketmaster called unprecedented demand to see the megastars Eras Tour.\r\nMy daughter told me, Theres nothing we can do about it. This is wrong, the Republican legislator told The Washington Post. I said, Actually, we can.\r\nAcross the country, lawmakers are introducing bills aimed at avoiding a repeat of the November Ticketmaster meltdown, in which many of Swifts fans tried and failed to buy tickets. The incident sparked waves of ire among Swift fans and policymakers alike, reigniting a debate over whether the companys outsize market dominance is failing consumers.\r\nIn May, Gov. Greg Abbott (R) signed into law the Save Our Swifties Act, introduced by Thimesch, imposing fines on scalpers who use bots to hoard tickets. Last year, New York state enacted a measure to crack down on scalping and control the ticket-resale market. In Minnesota, H.F. 1989 a reference to Swifts fifth studio album would require Ticketmaster and other companies to include their fees in prices upfront. And in Washington state, lawmakers are considering a bill aimed at regulating the secondary ticket market and stabilizing ticket prices.\r\nAnd thats only at the state level. Sens. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) and Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) have introduced a bill that would put federal regulatory scrutiny on the long-term contracts that Ticketmaster holds with concert venues an issue raised during a January Senate hearing in which lawmakers on both sides grilled a top company official.\r\nMeanwhile, Sens. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) and Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.) introduced a price transparency bill in April, and Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.) has proposed transparency and scalping reforms.\r\nIn the House, New Jersey Democratic Reps. Bill Pascrell Jr. and Frank Pallone Jr. have introduced the Boss and Swift Act (a nod to Bruce Springsteen), which seeks to enhance ticket-pricing transparency by updating legislation first introduced in 2009. A separate House bill, which President Biden hyped in his State of the Union address, takes aim at fees tacked on to ticket sales.\r\nIn the past, lawmakers and musicians have attempted to challenge Ticketmasters dominance, without much success. Pearl Jam boycotted the company in the 1990s and, despite some political momentum, largely failed to force big changes. Last August, Bruce Springsteen fans were shocked when ticket prices surged in some cases to $5,000. But the Swift Ticketmaster debacle, amplified by a mass of concertgoers who flocked to social media to vent, has given the issue new life, industry experts said.\r\nAnother major factor in the recent momentum: Swifts star power.\r\nSwifts most recent album, Midnights broke industry records with its release in October, dominating the top of the Billboard Hot 100 chart and becoming the most-streamed album in the first 24 hours of release on Spotify. More than 2 million tickets for the tour were sold the day of the Eras Tour rollout, the most ever in a single day, according to Ticketmaster.\r\nIts a lot of things that have to do with Taylor Swift, said Carolyn Sloane, an assistant professor of economics of the University of California at Riverside, on why this particular event spurred mass action.\r\nShe scaled her talent through demographic technology, Sloane continued. She got to her fans when they were very young, and she stuck with them. And then they went out into the world and made a case for how great she was to their parents and friends and everybody.\r\nThat group includes officials at the highest levels of the federal government, such as a bipartisan group of U.S. senators who repeatedly invoked Swift lyrics at a January hearing in which they questioned a panel about Ticketmasters dominance in the live events industry, as well as state lawmakers who responded to the ticketing crash with legislation named after the superstar.\r\nIn the case of the Save our Swifties law, for example, a penalty of up to $10,000 per violation would be imposed on scalpers who use bots to snap up tickets en masse. The measure, which will take effect in September, was supported by Ticketmaster and other ticketing agencies, Thimesch, the Texas Republican, said.\r\nIn Washington state, Rep. Kristine Reeves (D) introduced in January the TSWIFT Consumer Protection Act, which proposes limits on ticket resellers and expands the prohibition of using bots or software to buy tickets. The bill also proposed restrictions on dynamic pricing, which refers to price fluctuations based on demand.\r\nNotably, that proposal didnt receive the same support from Ticketmaster and other companies, Reeves said.\r\nTicketmaster was being helpful in Texas was because Texas was doing something in favor of Ticketmaster, Reeves said.

        "file_name": "2023-06-11_62359944.txt",
        "full_text": "The most confounding thing about a Lion Electric school bus is that its so simple.\r\nWorkers start with a few steel beams, a couple of dozen fiberglass panels around a metal body shell, and an electric motor that has 20 parts and is as big as a picnic basket.\r\nDiesel engines for large trucks, in contrast, have 2,000 parts. Theyre as big as grizzly bears.\r\nThe Lion Electric factory is confounding, too, mostly because its not in Mexico or China or some southern U.S. state where companies go to escape labor unions.\r\nThe factory is in Joliet, 30 miles southwest of Chicago, on a bluff 60 feet above the Des Plaines River. Its surrounded by warehouses, petrochemical plants and a Caterpillar factory that closed two years ago. Its an unlikely place for zero-emission manufacturing to flourish. But, during the spring of 2021, Gov. J.B. Pritzker beat out a site in Texas and won the Lion Electric plant for Joliet with a new type of strategic argument.\r\nPritzker convinced the Canadian company that in suburban Will County, electricity is not just cheap, reliable and abundant. Its also thanks to a statewide commitment Pritzker was then shepherding through the legislature on its way to being carbon-free by 2050.\r\nClean energy was a big plus for Marc Bedard, the Lion Electric chief executive officer. Bedard wants to run a zero-emission enterprise, and hes telling suppliers that someday soon hell refuse deliveries from fossil fuel-burning trucks.\r\nBedard is writing an updated rule book for Chicago manufacturing, even though hes new to town and even though state officials in Springfield have yet to throw their full weight behind his company.\r\nLion Electric brings the prospect of 1,400 jobs and the first new vehicle assembly plant to metropolitan Chicago since 1965. It offers hope that Illinois can put people to work attacking its most significant source of greenhouse gas pollution: tailpipe emissions from cars and trucks.\r\nThe Lion Electric factory is unquestionably a green feather in Pritzkers cap.\r\nEmployees work on the frame of a LionC electric school bus at the Lion Electric plant in Joliet. (E. Jason Wambsgans/Chicago Tribune)\r\nToday the factory is hiring new workers every week and hopes to have the capacity to make 2,500 buses annually by the end of 2023, Bedard said. In a few years, if all goes as planned, the Joliet plant could be building 20,000 buses and trucks a year, he said. Thats dozens of vehicles each day.\r\nBut two years have passed since the companys Joliet announcement. During that time, Illinois has failed to join in the parade of electric vehicle and battery plant announcements fueled by President Joe Bidens historic infrastructure spending.\r\n[\u00a0Canadian electric vehicle maker to build buses and trucks at new Joliet factory, creating 745 jobs over next three years\u00a0]\r\nGeorgia has been a big winner, with a staggering $23 billion in new electric vehicle investments since 2018. Georgia won out in part with lavish incentives, including $1.5 billion for Rivian Automotive to build electric trucks and SUVs at a factory with 7,500 workers east of Atlanta. Rivian began building vehicles in downstate Normal two years ago, and now employs a similar number there.\r\nIllinois spent just $7.9 million in incentives for the Lion Electric factory.\r\nWhen the Democratic-controlled legislature finished its spring session last month, lawmakers approved bills to make it easier for public-private partnerships to expand I-55 to 10 lanes from six through Black and brown Chicago neighborhoods where life expectancy is already being suppressed by congestion and truck pollution.\r\n[\u00a0Truck and rail backups clogged roads, creating more pollution and raising health risks for Chicagoans near freight corridors\u00a0]\r\nBut they adjourned without acknowledging the danger posed by this added pollution or considering any measures to mitigate it.\r\nThese include paying subsidies up to $120,000 per vehicle for electric trucks, and a requirement that Lion Electrics competitors will also have to build more battery-powered vehicles.\r\nWithout such measures, the clean-air benefits of the electric vehicles Pritzker wants to build in Illinois will be going to other states, said Brian Urbaszewski, director of the Respiratory Health Association in Chicago.\r\nLion Electric has invited Biden to its official ribbon-cutting in Joliet on July 21. Hell doubtlessly celebrate the $5 billion his Bipartisan Infrastructure Law set aside for electric school bus rebates last year. But like Lion Electric, the presidents clean energy revolution is still in a young and fragile state.\r\nThe Lion Electric plant in Joliet. (E. Jason Wambsgans/Chicago Tribune)\r\nThe companys stock dropped to $1.92 on June 6 from $33.48 in January 2021 as concern spread through Wall Street that the transition to a zero-emission economy will be slower and more expensive than many investors had hoped.\r\nLion Electric is not yet part of Illinois economic bedrock.\r\nIts more like the piping plovers that showed up unannounced on Montrose Beach in 2019 and became the first of their species to nest in Chicago in half a century.\r\nTheyre both hopeful signs about the states environment. But theyre still seeking the shelter and support they need to thrive.\r\n[\u00a0Piping plovers in Chicago: How the love story between Monty and Rose unfolded at Montrose Beach\u00a0]\r\nLion Electric is based in Saint-J\u00e9r\u00f4me, Quebec, an industrial suburb 35 miles northwest of Montreal.\r\nBedard, 57, started the company in 2008, soon after leaving his job as a merger and acquisitions analyst at accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers.\r\nIn person, Bedard comes across as a popular college professor more than a cigar-chomping industrialist. Hes never wavered from a simple idea that school buses would be the first big vehicles to go electric and would provide an entryway for his company into the commercial truck market thats 10 times bigger.\r\nHis basic logic has been impeccable so far, even if his timing has been off.\r\nSchool buses operate for two hours in the morning and two hours in the afternoon over routes that mostly dont change. This leaves plenty of time for charging in the same garage every night, often at off-peak electricity prices and with a relatively inexpensive slow charger.\r\nIn addition, the buses typically operate in stop-and-go traffic, allowing their brakes to capture more energy from the friction they generate as they stop the vehicle.\r\nBest of all, they dont subject school workers and their young passengers to dangerous diesel fumes.\r\nSchool districts in the United States now spend about $350,000 for a new electric bus, or 3\u00bd times more than a diesel counterpart, according to Curt Macysyn, executive director of the National School Transportation Association, a trade group.\r\nBy 2030, 30% of all new school bus sales in the United States will be powered by electric motors, according to a forecast by Gregory Genette of S&amp;P Global Mobility. This implies total annual sales of 35,000 electric buses.\r\nIts estimated that battery-powered vehicles will make up 20% of medium-duty truck sales by 2030 and 14% of new heavy-duty trucks, according to the S&amp;P forecast. This adds up to annual sales of about 95,000 battery-powered trucks, Genette said.\r\nFrancisco Lopez, of Joliet, smooths edges on a fiberglass body panel of a bus at the Lion Electric plant on June 5, 2023. (E. Jason Wambsgans/Chicago Tribune)\r\nLion Electric got a big head start in electric school buses because of determined efforts by government leaders in Quebec.\r\nThe province outlawed the registration of diesel school buses in 2021 and now offers subsidies up to $75,000 for each electric bus. Quebec also offers grants up to $150,000 for each electric truck.\r\nThe rebates are partly funded by a cap-and-trade system for carbon credits that Quebec launched with California in 2014. The program allows polluters to buy credits from companies reducing carbon dioxide emissions by, for example, using electricity from solar power instead of coal.\r\nKevin Matthews is head of electrification for First Student Inc., the largest North American school bus operator, with 46,000 vehicles providing 5.4 million student trips per day. The company operates 244 electric school buses, Matthews said, and Lion Electric built 230 of them. Weve been happy with their performance, Matthews said.\r\nOf the 2,490 bus replacements funded through the Biden infrastructure bill last year, Lion Electric has secured orders for 289 so far and is still trying to get more.\r\nMost of the rest were divided among the traditional U.S. players Blue Bird, Thomas Built and I.C. Bus. These companies convert a portion of their diesel fleets to run on electric motors and batteries.\r\nAccording to Pierre Fitzgibbon, the cabinet minister for innovation and the environment in Quebec, after pushing Lion Electric to the forefront of the electric school bus race, the province is determined to help the company stay there.\r\nIn April, amid muddy construction roads and unpaved parking lots at a cargo airport near Montreal, the company dedicated a $140 million factory to build battery packs. Of this amount, $75 million came from loans from the federal government of Canada and the province of Quebec, both eager to support the creation of 135 jobs.\r\nThe factory starts with battery cells that, like those used by Tesla, are a bit bigger than a Size AA household battery. A line of robots stacks, welds and seals thousands of cells, along with the necessary electronic controls and cooling equipment, inside a battery pack thats as big as a large suitcase.\r\nThe packs are central to Lion Electrics strategy. They encompass 40% of the cost of a bus. They required more than a decade of software writing so they can keep the batteries at an optimal operating temperature as they charge and discharge under a variety of circumstances. This helps them last longer.\r\nBatteries for a Lion6 electric school bus. (E. Jason Wambsgans/Chicago Tribune)\r\nWhen the companys factories are running at full speed, its electric buses wont cost any more to build than a diesel model, said Nate Baguio, senior vice president for commercial development in the United States.\r\nHe wouldnt specify when cost parity will happen, but he said its coming.\r\nBaguio said that Lion Electric customers currently need about seven years of lower maintenance and fuel costs to make up for the higher initial purchase price of a bus.\r\nPerformance data from the 950 Lion Electric buses on the road today indicate that many will last for 12 years, Baguio said.\r\nThe economics will improve even more, he said, as school boards learn to sell power back to the grid instead of letting the buses sit idle and as they start to recycle batteries.\r\nCurrently, many commercial fleets keep their diesel trucks for only five years before replacing them, Baguio said.\r\nAll these potential improvements are rooted in Lion Electrics ability to build its own battery packs.\r\nIts a competitive advantage that all of the companys competitors will need to match, said Sam Jaffe, senior director of business development for Addionics, a battery manufacturer based in London. And its only happening at Lion Electric because of government loans.\r\nThe roots of Quebecs environmental activism go back to 1971. Thats when the province started building a $15 billion hydroelectric generating station on the shores of James Bay, 600 miles north of Montreal. The project required diverting the course of three rivers and the flooding of Indigenous villages.\r\nToday, hydroelectric stations at James Bay and elsewhere generate 94% of Quebecs power, according to a government of Quebec website. The electricity they produce is abundant, cheap and clean. Its the cornerstone of Quebecs effort to transform itself into a green manufacturing hub, starting with the mining and processing of lithium, the assembly and recycling of battery cells, and the delivery of finished vehicles by companies such as Lion Electric.\r\nFitzgibbon, the innovation minister, says Quebec is too small to compete with the United States or even the province of Ontario for passenger cars and trucks. So its concentrating on niche products such as buses instead. And it wont bother with products that arent innovative and green.\r\nIf youre doing a gray battery, whats the point? asked Fitzgibbon, referring to batteries made with electricity from coal plants.\r\nPritzker also had energy on his mind as he tried to lure Lion Electric to Illinois.\r\nIn frequent phone calls with Bedard, Pritzker focused on a half-finished Joliet warehouse that could be converted quickly into a factory. And he touted the ability of Will County to produce power from every noncoal source: nuclear, natural gas, wind, solar and hydro.\r\nThe regions energy sources are diverse and plentiful. And before ComEds pending delivery charge increases take effect, theyre 35% cheaper for industrial users than the average for the countrys top 20 metro areas, according to Diana Sharpe, the utilitysvice president for large customers.\r\nPlus, under the Clean Energy Jobs Act, Pritzker was setting Illinois on a course to remove carbon dioxide emissions from energy productionby 2050. He did so partly by subsidizing nuclear plants in the last stages of their productive life and small towns dependent on coal plants that are closing.\r\n[\u00a0Gov. J.B. Pritzker hails energy plan with ambitious climate goals, nuclear bailout as a giant leap forward\u00a0]\r\nThis transition to largely renewable power is a significant drawing card for the low-emission industries that Illinois needs, said Doug Pryor, head of Will Countys economic development program and a direct participant in talks with Lion Electric.\r\nPryor said the state is constantly trying to recruit companies that make electric vehicles, batteries, solar panels, hydrogen-powered equipment such as fuel cells or hydrogen itself.\r\nThis electric motor will be installed on the chassis of a Lion6 electric school bus. (E. Jason Wambsgans/Chicago Tribune)\r\nWith the prospect of renewable power as a principal enticement, Pryor said he could turn his sales pitch to traditional Chicago-area advantages such as its central location, big consumer market, educated workers, abundant water and diverse transportation infrastructure.\r\nLion Electric quickly started plugging into the existing Illinois industrial base. Air conditioners come from Rockford, bumpers from Lockport and brakes from North Aurora.\r\nBut manufacturing as a percent of private-sector employment in the state fell to 11.9% in 2021 from 32% in 1950, according to Matthew Wilson of the Great Cities Institute at the University of Illinois at Chicago. Factory jobs disappeared as productivity rose and investment shifted to other countries and states.\r\nAnd Chicagos legacy as a union town was a constant issue.\r\nEven with Bidens pro-union stance, more than four-fifths of the clean-energy production facilities announced in the six months after the Inflation Reduction Act went to right-to-work states, according to a Reuters report. These states weaken unions by allowing workers to not pay dues.\r\nPritzker caught a lucky break when Bedard declined to join this right-to-work exodus.\r\nIts going to be their decision in Illinois if they want to go with a labor union, Bedard said.\r\nThe United Steelworkers union has already staked a claim with successful organizing drives at electric bus factories in California and Georgia and community benefit agreements that provide training and other assistance to workers who need it.\r\nBedard differs from many corporate executives in other ways.\r\nLion Electric does its best, he said, to avoid component suppliers based in countries that allow child labor or that are run by totalitarian governments.\r\nLike many parts of the United States, Illinois has substantially more job openings than unemployed people.\r\nA LionC electric school bus sits in the process of being assembled on June 5, 2023. (E. Jason Wambsgans/Chicago Tribune)\r\nEric Pansegrau, the general manager at Joliet, said hes experienced no significant problems recruiting his workforce so far. He describes the starting hourly pay of $21 plus benefits such as health insurance and a 401(k) retirement savings plan as competitive with surrounding employers.\r\nKeith Gullquist, 52, has worked as a team leader at Lion Electric for a year.\r\nHe said he doesnt think much about protecting the environment with zero-emission vehicles. But he said he likes the challenge of launching a new type of factory for battery-powered vehicles.\r\nGullquist said he was the first worker in Joliet to use a spray gun to apply a rust-fighting coating to the bottom of the bus and enjoyed the challenges of hitting all the nooks and crannies.\r\nI like to have to figure stuff out, he said.\r\nKeith Gullquist, of Braidwood, works on a LionC electric school bus at the Lion Electric plant on May 24, 2023. (E. Jason Wambsgans/Chicago Tribune)\r\nA big chunk of the factorys 906,517-square-foot expanse is covered with boxes of parts and components since workers still havent finished the racks to stack them up in the back. Pansegrau says he has bar-coded and scanned each box to know where everything is.\r\nMuch of the work at Lion Electric now occurs by hand. For example, workers stand at a small table to attach rubber sealers and metal frames around the window panes.\r\nIn the future, Pansegrau said, such components will arrive fully assembled. This will help workers keep up with mobile robots called AGVs that will haul the buses along the assembly line at an accelerating pace.\r\nAs Bedard readily admits, the main cloud on this horizon is that electric truck sales are lagging years behind the companys expectations.\r\nA case in point is Amazon. Two years ago, the online retailer said it may buy as many as 2,500 trucks from Lion Electric by the end of 2025. So far, Bedard says, Amazon has purchased just 10.\r\nKatie Loughnane, an Amazon spokeswoman, declined to comment.\r\nAmazon has a similar but much larger agreement to purchase up to 100,000 trucks from Rivian. But the retailer dialed back its purchases from both companies amid a slowdown in e-commerce sales. That, in turn, could force Rivian to compete directly with Lion Electric for new delivery truck customers.\r\n[\u00a0Rivian laying off 6% of its workforce as EV manufacturer aims to cut costs\u00a0]\r\nLion Electric is in regular contact with Amazon and will be ready when theyve really got to go electric, Bedard said. As this crucial moment approaches, he said, hed rather have too much manufacturing capacity than too little.\r\nBedard said he expects a significant boost in January when California starts requiring regional fleets that operate between the states ports and nearby rail yards to register only zero-emission vehicles.\r\nLionC electric school buses are parked inside the Lion Electric plant in Joliet. (E. Jason Wambsgans/Chicago Tribune)\r\nLion Electric delivered 220 trucks and buses in the first quarter of 2023, up from 84 in the year-ago period. These sales generated $54.7 million in revenue, of which the company lost $15.6 million. According to management estimates, Lion Electric had orders on hand for 2,565 trucks and buses worth $625 million.\r\nLion Electric doesnt provide formal earnings guidance to investors. When asked on an investor call when the company will break even, Bedard would say only that earnings will improve with higher volumes.\r\nBedard will get some breathing room as he finishes paying off the $105 million Joliet plant and as bus sales continue to grow.\r\nThe bus business is pretty good, he said. We can go for a while.\r\nIn the meantime, Bedard said he hopes and expects Illinois to follow the example of environmental leaders such as Quebec and California and offer incentives for electric trucks.\r\nI think Illinois is working hard on making this happen, Bedard said. Are they there yet? No. Is there still a very good potential? Yes.\r\nBedard said he expects electric bus and truck sales to continue rising even if political parties with sharply different views on climate policies gain and lose power in the United States and Canada.\r\nThis is where the market is going, even if some parties might think differently on a short-term basis, Bedard said. Its a green thing, you know, where you can make money.\r\nFor Pritzker, a big chance to lure more of this green thing to Illinois will come in September.\r\nThats when the United Auto Workers union and Stellantis N.V. will renegotiate their labor contract.\r\nThe unions recently elected president, Shawn Fain, is demanding new investments in Belvidere, where the company closed a 58-year-old factory in February and laid off 1,350 workers.\r\n[\u00a0Stellantis idling Belvidere Jeep Cherokee plant indefinitely, laying off 1,350 auto workers\u00a0]\r\nIts unacceptable, Fain told reporters. Ive been very clear with the corporation that we expect things there to change.\r\nPritzker is standing by with a $400 million incentive fund that the legislature has already approved. Hes hoping the company will build a new factory for its coming electric flagship, the Ram 1500 Rev pickup.\r\nWere in a pretty good place with Stellantis, Pritzker said in an interview Wednesday. They understand were providing significant incentives.\r\nBut theres no well-established political consensus in Illinois about whether and how to expand these efforts in the future, unlike in California or Quebec.\r\nPritzker shows no sign of embracing California-style mandates on how many electric vehicles must be sold in Illinois. He backs a plan that would require state and local government fleets in Illinois, aside from police departments, to purchase only electric vehicles starting in 2030. But that measure got sidelined as legislators rushed to approve hundreds of other bills before adjourning in May.\r\nLawmakers did approve a bill making it easier for public-private partnerships to expand I-55 to 10 lanes through the South and West sides. Pritzker said he hasnt taken a position. There are some unions on the one side, and theres the environmental community on the other side, Pritzker said. You do need to reach some consensus.\r\nIn the meantime, the governor is rolling out new incentives through his Reimagining Energy and Electric Vehicles program. These incentives dont grab headlines. But just one provision, reduced payroll taxes, could be worth tens of millions of dollars to big manufacturers like Stellantis.\r\nPritzker said these incentives help him argue that electric vehicle incentives in Illinois are as strong or nearly as strong as other states.\r\nIn April, Pritzker announced a $27 million subsidy to help school boards buy electric school buses and charging stations.\r\nWere going to continue to work on providing the right kinds of incentives so that companies like Lion, as well as the automobile manufacturers, see Illinois as a great place, he said.\r\nOn Thursday, Crains Chicago Business reported that Pritzker interrupted leadership talks last week to meet with a battery-maker thats eyeing a new factory in Morris, a Joliet suburb. The governor may have offered incentives worth $600 million, Crains said. Pritzker is in talks with three different companies, includingone from China and one from Europe.\r\nPoliticians like such incentives because they demonstrate environmental progress without requiring voters to make really hard choices, such as driving less or building fewer highways, said Pierre-Olivier Pineau, chairman of energy sector management at HEC Montreal, a business school.\r\nFrom a political perspective, electric vehicles are perfect because you can tell people, You just have to change the vehicle, but you dont have to change your lifestyle, he said.\r\nEveryone will say, Oh, for the kids, its very good to have a clean bus, Pineau said. Lion Electric is not that big but theyve been used as example so often that the government will continue to help them. It means theyre too big to fail.\r\nChicago Tribunes Dan Petrella contributed.\r\nJohn Lippert is a freelancer.",

        "full_text": "In this detailed article, we'll research where aluminum is found in the world and find the largest aluminum producing countries. If you want brief knowledge on which nations are driving the international market of this widely-used and mined metal, read 5 Largest Aluminum Producing Countries In The World.\u00a0\r\nAluminum is the third most abundant element in the Earth's crust, comprising approximately 8% by weight. However, aluminum rarely exists in its pure form and is typically found in bauxite ore. Bauxite deposits are in a wide belt around the equator, with the largest bauxite reserves in Guinea, Australia, Vietnam, and Brazil.\u00a0\r\nFurthermore, the commercial extraction of aluminum also happens in China, which amounts to 58% aluminum smelter production. China asserted its dominance as the largest producer of aluminum in the world in 2022, owing to its extensive year-end mining capacity.\u00a0\r\nSince China also has the largest aluminum reserves in the world and immense smelting capacity,its assertion as the leading producer is undisputed. However, environmental concerns and resource-intensive aluminum smelting are obstacles to the country's aluminum industry.\r\nOther leading countries in aluminum production are Russia and India, which, despite having smaller bauxite reserves, produce a significant percentage of aluminum because of huge domestic demand and integrated production systems. Notably, Russia's aluminum industry, driven by Rusal, has flourished despite geopolitical pressures and economic sanctions.\u00a0\r\nSince aluminum production depends on a country's bauxite mining, we recommend reading Top 20 Largest Producers of Bauxite In The World.\r\nGlobal Aluminum Market\r\nGlobal aluminum market was $179.32 billion in 2022 and is projected to reach $277.5 billion by 2031 by the end of this decade. This market will grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.61% from 2022 to 2031 and further contribute to the GDP of the largest aluminum producing countries in the world.\r\nDeveloping sectors like automotive, construction, and packaging industries require aluminum to meet their production. Therefore, the global aluminum consumption in 2022 was recorded to be 65.87 million metric tons. This figure is projected to reach 78.4 million metric tons by 2029, owing to the expansion in major industries worldwide. Since aluminum is lightweight, durable, and corrosion-resistant, it has been increasingly adopted as a preferred manufacturing material.\u00a0\r\nWhile this increase is a positive sign for the major aluminum producing countries in the world, the depletion of its reserves is concerning. Hence, countries are implementing more diverse aluminum recycling efforts to reduce the load of smelters. In the automotive and building sectors, aluminum recycling reaches up to 90%. As a result, 75% of aluminum ever produced is still in use today, indicative of this industry's long-term stability.\u00a0\r\nIf you want to know which metal stocks you should load up on, take a look at 11 Best Metal Stocks To Buy Now and grow your financial footprint.\u00a0\r\nMain Alumining Mining Companies\u00a0\r\nAlcoa Corporation (NYSE:AA) is the largest American aluminum company that holds a prominent position in aluminum mining. Alcoa Corporation (NYSE:AA) has headquarters in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and spearheads the industry through its expansive bauxite mining to the manufacturing of aluminum products. Alcoa Corporation (NYSE:AA) focuses on sustainable mining so the raw sources for aluminum don't get unfairly exploited.\u00a0\r\nAnother prominent name in the aluminum industry is the Rio Tinto Group (NYSE:RIO). In 2022, Rio Tinto Group (NYSE:RIO) produced a substantial 521,100 metric tons out of a total of 3 million metric tons of aluminum. Rio Tinto Group (NYSE:RIO) is also the world largest aluminum-producer company, with a market capitalization of $116 billion. It has well-planned mining strategies that don't exhaust aluminum resources from the Top 10 largest aluminum producing countries in the world.\u00a0\r\nAnother company doing well in aluminum mining is Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE), based in Charlotte, North Carolina. Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) aims to improve the quality of its aluminum products, increase yield, and minimize environmental impact. Notably, Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) emphasizes recycling efforts that underscore its commitment to sustainable mineral exploitation.\u00a0\r\n15 Largest Aluminum Producing Countries In The World\r\nPhoto by Shane Cottle on Unsplash\r\nOur Methodology\u00a0\r\nWe relied on the USGS Mineral Commodity Summaries of 2023 and 2018 as our primary data sources to rank the 15 largest aluminum producing countries. Owing to its diverse data sources, USGS provides extensive and annually updated databases on all minerals to showcase which country produces maximum aluminum in the world.\r\nThe annual USGS reports offer well-documented information that covers multiple aspects related to minerals, i.e., production, consumption, and trade. As we analyzed the summaries, we studied the sections focusing on aluminum to understand the aluminum production statistics of all major countries. Moreover, since the 2023 summary focused on the 11 largest aluminum producers, we dug deep into the SUSG summaries from 2018, 2019, and 2020. Eventually, we were able to rank based on solid aluminum production statistics for a clear perspective on this global market.\r\nBased on our understanding of where aluminum is found in the world, here are this metal's largest producers:\u00a0\u00a0\r\n15. Brazil\u00a0\r\nAluminum Smelter Production in 2018: 0.66 million metric tons\u00a0\r\nBrazil hit 0.66 million metric tons of aluminum in 2018, and impacted the global market of this key industrial metal. The largest alumina mine in Brazil is the MRN mine, owned by Vale S.A. (NYSE:VALE), which extracted 10.46 million metric tons of bauxite in 2022, a major portion of which went to aluminum production.\u00a0\r\n14. Qatar\u00a0\r\nAluminum Smelter Production in 2019: 0.697 million metric tons\u00a0\r\nData reveals that Qatar's aluminum smelter output reached 0.697 million metric tons in 2019. This industry-specific statistic hints at the Gulf nation's significant role in the global aluminum sector. The most notable aluminum smelter in Qatar is Qatalum, located in the Mesaieed Industrial Area as a joint venture between QatarEnergy and Norsk Hydro.\u00a0\r\n13. South Africa\r\nAluminum Smelter Production in 2019: 0.699 million metric tons\u00a0\r\nSouth Africa's aluminum sector achieved a noteworthy output of 0.699 million metric tons from its smelters in 2019. This data indicates the significance of aluminum production to South Africa's economy and advancements in its smelting operations. The largest aluminum smelter in the Northern Hemisphere, named Hillside Aluminium, is also located in Richards Bay, South Africa.\r\n12. Iceland\u00a0\r\nAluminum Smelter Production in 2022: 0.75 million metric tons\u00a0\r\nIceland's aluminum production capacity experienced noteworthy utilization of 0.75 million metric tons in 2022. This achievement owes to the country's renewable geothermal and hydroelectric energy sources to fuel the energy-intensive smelting process. The Grundartangi smelter in Iceland alone has a production capacity of approximately 317,000 metric tonnes of aluminum with its low-cost operations.\u00a0\r\n11. Malaysia\u00a0\r\nAluminum Smelter Production in 2017: 0.76 million metric tons\u00a0\r\nMalaysia, owing to its 110 million metric tons of bauxite reserves, demonstrated significant industrial productivity in the non-ferrous metals sector. The country's output amounted to 0.76 million metric tons of smelted aluminum in 2017.\u00a0\r\n10. Saudi Arabia\u00a0\r\nAluminum Smelter Production in 2019: 0.85 million metric tons\r\nThe major alumina refinery in KSA is Ma'aden Bauxite and Alumina Company (MBAC), with a mining capacity of 1.8 million metric tons of alumina. Reports indicate Saudi Arabia yielded 0.85 million metric tons of aluminum in 2019. This smelter, paired with the country's capacity, makes it a top player in the global aluminum market.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n9. United States\r\nAluminum Smelter Production in 2022: 0.86 million metric tons\r\nAs per the USGS summary, the United States had an aluminum smelter production of 0.86 million metric tons in 2022. Although not exceptional, this yield is a result of the major US aluminum smelters operating at their full capacity. Some smelters also worked at reduced capacity because of increased mining costs and energy shortages but impacted industry demands in the automotive, packaging, and construction sectors.\u00a0\r\n8. Norway\u00a0\r\nAluminum Smelter Production in 2022: 1.4 million\r\nData reveals that Norway mined 1.4 million metric tons of aluminum in 2022. The biggest aluminum refinery in Norway is Norsk Hydro, which operates many aluminum plants in Sunndal, \u00c5rdal, and Husnes. It's also Europe's third-largest aluminum maker that impacts this non-ferrous metal industry, and helps Norway's resource management strategies.\r\n7. Australia\u00a0\r\nAluminum Smelter Production in 2022: 1.5 million metric tons\r\nAustralia generated 1.4 million metric tons of aluminum in 2022 via its vast smelters and refineries. Its\u00a0largest aluminum smelter is Tomago Aluminum, which has been functional since 1983 and contributes $2.2 billion annually to the country's economy. Tomago's robust infrastructure and innovative processing techniques continually support Australia's steady climb in global aluminum production rankings.\r\n6. Bahrain\u00a0\r\nAluminum Smelter Production in 2022: 1.6 million metric tons\u00a0\r\nThe Kingdom of Bahrain has been influencing this metal's market over the years. In 2022, Bahrain's smelter production was 1.6 million metric tons of aluminum. Aluminium Bahrain (Alba) is the world's 2nd largest and Bahrain's largest aluminum smelter, with a production capacity of 1.548 million metric tons. This smelter has also fostered stable growth in Bahrain's non-oil sector, owing to its diverse refining infrastructure.\u00a0\r\nClick to continue reading 5 Largest Aluminum Producing Countries In The World.\r\nSuggested Articles:\r\nDisclosure: None. 15 Largest Aluminum Producing Countries In The World is originally published on Insider Monkey.",

I'd now like to turn the call over to Allan. Allan?\r\nAllan Thygesen: Thanks, Heather, and good afternoon, everyone. We're pleased to have delivered a solid start to the fiscal year, reporting financial metrics that exceeded our guidance. We announced new product innovations to enable smarter, easier, trusted agreement workflows. First, some highlights from this quarter's financial results. Q1 total revenue came in at $661 million, up 12% versus prior year. Q1 non-GAAP operating margin came in at a healthy 27%, driven by our continued focus on profitability and efficiency. We're pleased with the early traction we're making against our objectives. However, we do continue to operate in a challenging macro environment with cautious customer sentiment, evident in moderating expansion rates.\r\nLast quarter, I shared our plans to accelerate our product release cycles in fiscal 2024. What you'll see is that our roadmap builds on DocuSign's strength as the world's leading e-signature company while also moving us towards enabling the entire agreement journey with intelligent workflows. We're deepening these capabilities to deliver more strategic value to our customers. With that, let me touch on three new releases that shipped this quarter. First, as mentioned on the Q4 call, DocuSign Web Forms launched in April. In the first few weeks since launch, we're seeing strong traction for Web Forms across verticals, including financial services, real estate, healthcare and life sciences, leveraging our differentiated approach to streamlining how agreements are generated.\r\nWeb Forms are simple and powerful for both senders and signers. They're easy to use and customers benefit from the ability to more easily capture and leverage data from their agreements. Next, we made strong progress penetrating and innovating in highly regulated markets. One example is our work in the healthcare vertical, which is undergoing dramatic digital transformation. We're proud that our e-signature product can now seamlessly connect to electronic health records in the U.S. market, including from Epic and Cerner in accordance with industry standards. This will modernize the patient experience and improve efficiency for healthcare companies, while also deepening DocuSign's presence within the vertical. And finally, we introduced DocuSign ID Verification Premier, our tier of ID solutions which meet the highest levels of trust, security and compliance.\r\nOur first offering within this tier is ID verification for EU Qualified e-signature. By combining verification of an ID with confirmation of the presence of the person on the ID, it fully replaces face-to-face verifications and a handwritten signature under EU law. We look forward to leveraging this powerful offering as we expand our business in Europe. More broadly, our strategy is to partner closely with leading identity services companies to leverage -- to integrate the best breed solutions into our platform. Looking ahead, I'd like to share our vision and thinking on generative AI. In brief, we believe AI unlocks the true potential of the intelligent agreement category. We already have a strong track record, leveraging sophisticated AI models, having built and shipped solutions based on earlier generations of AI.\r\nPhoto by DocuSign on Unsplash\r\nGenerative AI can transform all aspects of agreement workflow, and we are uniquely positioned to capitalize on this opportunity. As an early example, we recently introduced a new limited availability feature Agreement Summarization. This new feature, which is enabled by our integration with Microsoft's Azure OpenAI service and tuned with our own proprietary agreement model, uses AI to summarize and documents critical components, giving signers a clear grasp of the most relevant information within their agreement while respecting data security and privacy. Future launches will include search across customer agreement libraries, extractions from agreements and proposed language and edits based on customer, industry and universal best practices.\r\nDocuSign is a trusted partner to leading companies across many industries. As the leader in agreement workflows, we can use AI to deliver important value to customers by leveraging the world's largest set of agreement data, our proprietary agreement models and deep integrations with best-in-class third-party models. We're excited to showcase new products and enhancements at our -- on our intelligent agreement roadmap, including significant AI-powered innovations at our user conference Momentum. The event will kick off next week in Santa Clara with virtual and in-person events in eight cities around the globe over the next few months. Turning to our initiatives around our omnichannel go-to-market. We are continuing to drive deep relationships within our partner ecosystem and enhancing our AI capabilities.\r\nWe were honored to be showcased in the main keynote of Microsoft's Build Conference as one of the first companies using Microsoft Azure OpenAI. This further underscores our growing relationship with Microsoft and the opportunities we're seeing to enhance our AI capabilities. During the quarter, we also joined the SAP Endorsed Apps program. E-signature has been rigorously tested and validated by SAP to ensure that it seamlessly integrates with SAP solutions and meets their high standards for quality and performance. We're pleased with the progress we're seeing across our partner ecosystem, which will continue to drive further adoption of our products globally. Last quarter, I shared how we are investing in product-led growth and self-serve capabilities in order to drive more go-to-market efficiency and deliver a better experience for our customers.\r\nThis is one of our most important areas of investment as we evolve how DocuSign goes to market and further integrate our digital, direct and partner selling motions. Our digital business had stronger relative performance in Q1 as we launched a number of improvements on our website and within our product experience. These changes were designed to grow traffic, improve conversion rates and drive monetization, and it's just the beginning. Whether it's a small business or a large enterprise, our vision is to make it easy for every type of customer to buy and consume our products in any way they prefer, self-serve, through our direct sales teams or through a partner. Turning to our go-to-market execution in the first quarter. We're pleased with how our field team navigated the distractions in Q1 as we rebalanced our approach.\r\nHowever, we are seeing more moderate pipeline and cautious customer behavior, coupled with smaller deal sizes and lower volumes. We recognize it's a dynamic competitive environment across multiple categories. We're confident in our premium positioning, especially in complex and high-value use cases. As we've stated, international expansion remains a largely untapped opportunity for us. We're making investments not only with market-specific product innovation like identity verification, but also in stronger local market presence to strengthen our footprint. We recently released funding to further invest in Germany and Japan. And in Japan, note, we just went live with our first CLM customer this past quarter. Further supporting our focus on the international expansion, I'm pleased to share that Anna Marrs, Group President of Global Commercial Services and Credit &amp; Fraud Risk at American Express, has joined our Board of Directors and as a member of the Audit Committee.\r\nShe is a fantastic operating executive with deep global experience and will be a great asset to the Board and the leadership team. Finally, I am thrilled with the key hires we've announced to round out our leadership team. Most notably, Blake Grayson will be joining as DocuSign's new CFO next week. Blake's considerable track record and experience in finance leadership roles in category-leading public companies, including Amazon and The Trade Desk, make him a very strong addition to the DocuSign leadership team. I'd also like to take this opportunity to once again thank, you, Cynthia, for her tremendous contributions to DocuSign as both a Board member and as our CFO for the last four-and-a-half years. I'm grateful for her partnership and strategic leadership as the company navigated immense change.\r\nIn closing, we had a solid start to the year with strong financial results, continued traction on the key pillars of our strategic vision to transform agreement workflows and intelligence and in rounding out our leadership team with high-caliber talent. We look forward to continuing to share progress as we execute against our initiatives this year. Now, let me turn the call over to Cynthia to walk through our financial results and outlook.\r\nCynthia Gaylor: Thank you, Allan, and thanks to everyone for joining the call today. We had a solid start to the year, exceeding our top-line and operating margin guidance. We made progress during the quarter against our priority initiatives and demonstrated leverage in our operating model. We remain focused on delivering value for our customers with easy-to-use high ROI products, which in today's macro environment continues to be increasingly important as customers look for ways to drive more efficiency in their businesses. With that, let me turn to our Q1 fiscal '24 results. For the first quarter, total revenue increased 12% year-over-year to $661 million, and subscription revenue grew 12% year-over-year to $639 million. Our international revenue grew 17% year-over-year and reached $168 million for the first quarter, representing 25% of revenue.\r\nFirst quarter billings rose 10% year-over-year to $675 million. As a reminder, billings can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter due to the timing of deals and complexion of renewals. The macro environment continues to create uncertainty for our customers, and we're seeing the impact of smaller deal sizes and lower expansion rates across the business as customers scrutinize budgets. Q1 billings outperformance was driven by a higher rate of on-time renewals. We are encouraged by initial signs of improved sales execution across our installed base. We added approximately 45,000 new customers during the quarter, bringing our total customer base to 1.4 million, a 13% increase year-over-year. This includes the addition of approximately 9,000 direct customers to reach a total direct customer base of 220,000, a 21% year-on-year increase.\r\nWe also saw a 20% year-over-year increase in customers with an annualized contract value greater than $300,000, reaching a total of 1,063 customers. The slight decline quarter-on-quarter was primarily driven by customer buying patterns, lower expansion rates and partial churn. Dollar net retention was 105% for the quarter. We continue to see headwinds impacting our expansion rates coupled with muted customer buying patterns in a tough macro environment as budgets remain under scrutiny and customers optimize existing spend. Looking ahead, we expect the Q2 dollar net retention rate to continue to experience downward pressure. From a vertical perspective, we saw pockets of relative strength within insurance and business services, highlighting the importance of our diverse customer base and durability of our model, while we continue to see headwinds across financial services and real estate.\r\nNon-GAAP gross margin for the first quarter was 83% compared with 81% a year ago. First quarter subscription gross margin was 85% compared with 84% a year ago. Q1 non-GAAP operating income reached $176 million compared with $102 million last year. We delivered a record non-GAAP operating margin of 27% compared to 17% last year. This year-on-year improvement demonstrates our focus on profitability and the leverage in our business model. We remain committed to investing in a disciplined way to transform broader agreement workflows that will drive our top-line over time. As we move through the year and execute against our operating plan, we expect a quarterly decrease in operating margin. Non-GAAP net income for Q1 was $150 million compared with $77 million in the first quarter of 2023.\r\nThe fiscal 2024 non-GAAP tax rate remains at 20%. Q1 non-GAAP EPS was $0.72. We ended Q1 with 6,586 employees compared to 7,642 the year prior. Operating cash flow in the first quarter grew 19% year-over-year to a record high of $234 million or a 35% margin. This compares with $196 million or 33% in the same quarter a year ago. Q1 collections were at an all-time high, benefiting from seasonality and enhanced automation and operational efficiency. Operating cash flow includes one-time cash expenses of $20 million in Q1 related to the 2024 restructuring plan we announced in February. Free cash flow for the quarter was $215 million or a 32% margin compared to $175 million or 30% in the prior year, a 23% year-on-year increase. We exited Q1 with more than $1.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and investments.\r\nTurning to our share repurchase program. We repurchased over 700,000 shares during the quarter for approximately $40 million, which demonstrates our confidence in the durability of our business. As a reminder, we have strong cash flow and an attractive balance sheet that gives us flexibility to optimize our capital structure with a focus on opportunistically returning capital to our shareholders. With that, let me turn to our Q2 and fiscal '24 guidance. While we are pleased with our Q1 financial results, it is still early in the year, and we remain cautious in our outlook, given moderating expansion rates and slowing customer demand, driven by the uncertainty in the current macro environment and continued competition, particularly in more basic e-signature use cases.\r\nFor the second quarter and fiscal year '24, we anticipate total revenue of $675 million to $679 million in Q2 or growth of 8% to 9% year-over-year, and $2.713 billion to $2.725 billion for fiscal '24 or a growth of 8% year-on-year. Of this, we expect subscription revenue of $658 million to $662 million in Q2 or growth of 9% year-on-year and $2.64 billion to $2.652 billion for fiscal '24 or growth of 8% to 9% year-over-year. For billings, we expect $646 million to $656 million in Q2 or flat to 1% growth year-over-year, and $2.737 billion to $2.757 billion for fiscal '24 or growth of 3% to 4% year-over-year. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be 81% to 82% for both Q2 and fiscal '24. We expect non-GAAP operating margin to reach 24% to 25% for Q2 and 22% to 24% for fiscal '24.\r\nWe expect non-GAAP fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding of 207 million to 212 million for both Q2 and fiscal '24. We're pleased with the financial results in Q1, along with the resilience and focus the team has demonstrated as we continue to evolve the business. We maintain a disciplined and focused approach to delivering profitability at scale as we invest for the long term. In closing, I want to thank our amazing team for their commitment to delivering for our customers and partners and driving forward the vision for smarter, easier and trusted agreements. On a personal note, the last four-and-a-half years has been an incredible adventure, helping the company operationalize tremendous growth at scale, while providing a stabilizing force through unprecedented change.\r\nI'm looking forward to what comes next and to seeing DocuSign continue to be the innovator of defining how the world agrees. With that, we will open up the call for questions.

        "full_text": "Braze, Inc. (NASDAQ:BRZE) Q1 2024 Earnings Call Transcript June 8, 2023\r\nBraze, Inc. beats earnings expectations. Reported EPS is $-0.13, expectations were $-0.18.\r\nOperator: Welcome to the Braze First Quarter Fiscal Year 2024 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Anne and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker's presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call over to Christopher Ferris, Head of Braze Investor Relations.\r\nChristopher Ferris: Thank you, operator. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today to review Braze's results for the fiscal first quarter 2024. I'm joined by our Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer, Bill Magnusson; and our Chief Financial Officer, Isabelle Winkles. We announced our results in a press release issued after the market closed today. Please refer to the Investor Relations section of our website at investors.braze.com for more information and a supplemental presentation related to today's earnings announcement. During this call, we will make statements related to our business that are forward-looking under the federal securities laws and the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.\r\nThese statements include but are not limited to, statements regarding our financial outlook for the second quarter ended July 31, 2023 and for our fiscal year ended January 31, 2024, our planned product and feature development and the benefits to us and our customers therefrom, including our AI features, the potential impact and duration of current macroeconomic trends, our anticipated customer behaviors including vendor consolidation trends and their impact on Braze and our long-term financial targets and goals, including the anticipated period in which we may generate positive non-GAAP operating income, and positive free cash flow. These statements are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations and reflect our views only as of today.\r\nWe assume no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements. For a discussion of the material risks and uncertainties that could affect our actual results, please refer to the risks identified in today's press release and our SEC filings, both available on the Investor Relations section of our website. I'd also like to remind you that today's call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures used by management to evaluate our ongoing operations and to aid investors in further understanding the company's fiscal first quarter 2024 performance in addition to the impact these items have on the financial results. Please refer to the reconciliations of our non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP included in our earnings release under the Investor Relations section of our website.\r\nThe non-GAAP financial measures provided should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Bill.\r\nBill Magnuson: Thank you, Chris, and good afternoon, everyone We're very pleased with our first quarter performance, which again demonstrated the power of the Braze customer engagement platform, even against the challenging macroeconomic background. We got off to a great start to the year, generating $101.8 million in revenue, up 31% versus the prior year, while driving operating efficiency in the business. Non-GAAP gross margins increased 100 basis points year-over-year and we demonstrated strong leverage with non-GAAP operating margins improving by over 700 basis points compared to the first quarter of last year. We also generated record free cash flow of $21.7 million, driven in part by solid fourth quarter bookings. As we progress through fiscal 2024, we plan to continue driving strong top-line growth while maintaining cost discipline and believe we are well on our way to achieving the near and long-term profitability goals outlined on our fourth quarter call in March.\r\nBrands continue to recognize the high ROI that can be achieved through personalized cross-channel customer engagement enabled by the Braze platform. In the first quarter, we increased our total customer count by 96 sequentially to a total of 1,866 continuing to win against both legacy Marketing Clouds and Point Solutions with our best-in-class customer engagement platform. Recent new business wins and upsells included Procore Technologies, Sonos, Sweetgreen, and Swimply, among many others. We continue to realize strong growth across multiple customer classes, geographies and verticals with both retail e-commerce and media and entertainment showing particularly strong year-over-year growth during the period. Braze again benefited from vendor consolidation this quarter and we believe this trend will continue as enterprises with ambition and sophistication consolidate our technology ecosystem with modern omnichannel customer engagement solutions like Braze.\r\nWe further believe that both the legacy replacement cycle and this vendor consolidation trend will accelerate as customers look to capitalize on new AI-driven advancements in customer engagement, an area of innovation, which benefits tremendously from the breadth of Braze's data footprint and messaging flexibility, as well as our real-time stream processing architecture. As I mentioned on our fourth quarter earnings call, existing at the leading edge of technology is in our DNA and at the core of our innovation roadmap. Braze is a company that perceives the opportunity presented by the coming wide-scale adoption of mobile more than a decade ago. And since then we've worked relentlessly to seize that opportunity through the use of sophisticated technology.\r\nFor years Braze's had dedicated teams of data engineers and data scientists, focused on using machine learning to build AI into our product, with the goal of making marketers more effective and engaging their end users by optimizing customer journeys, generating more relevant content and enhancing targeting strategies. Even more importantly, we believe that the ability to use machine learning and generative AI are as fundamental to being a software engineer as using databases and writing secure code. As new technologies emerge, including but not limited to breakthroughs in artificial intelligence, our forward-looking R&amp;D posture and highly extensible foundations allow us to quickly deliver innovation to our customers. You can see this track record in not only our long history of activating real-time first-party data through stream processing, but also with AI, including generative AI more recently.\r\nBraze debuted a GPT integration for email subject line generation over a year ago and we were early to integrate generative AI for images into the message composition experience, launching a dashboard integration with Dolly last December. More recently, we launched a message content checking tool, built on top of GPT4, helping marketers to avoid copyrighting mistakes, the accidental sending of text messages or sending culturally insensitive content. We're also testing a wide array of new capabilities including generating SQL for advanced segmentation and reporting use cases, automatically suggesting improvements to message copy during composition and even an adversarial AB testing simulator that we believe may be able to generate and predict winning message variants for populations before a campaign is even launched.\r\nsoftware, tehnology, laptop\r\nPhoto by Danial Igdery on Unsplash\r\nCustomers have been successfully using both our AI copyrighting assistant and automatic image generation for months to generate message content and inspire new engagement strategies. Lowering the burden of content creation while also serving as an in dashboard news encourages customers to bring new use cases into Braze more quickly, while also expanding their usage of the powerful experimentation features native to Canvas, our proprietary, no-code visual development environment. We believe this enhanced agility and reduce burden to test new ideas, further combines with our other machine learning driven experiment optimization capabilities, further compounding the ROI we deliver to our customers. We know from our customer base that even small or one person teams can still accomplish a lot with Braze and as a company that has never charged for seats, we expect to see generative AI-driven productivity enhancements for individual marketers translate into even more Braze usage over time.\r\nWe believe this will further cement our stickiness and promote expansion into new user populations, driving higher message volumes and the adoption of more channels. Internally, we talk a lot about smoothing the on-ramp into Braze as a key part of ensuring that the differentiation presented by Braze's sophisticated capabilities remains broadly accessible to our ever-growing market, even to those who are early in their journey of adopting the modern practice of customer engagement. Over the last five years, we've seen an acceleration of two trends that highlight the importance of tackling this challenge, which also translates into a deeper moat for Braze's technology and our customer community. First is the rising imperative of collecting first-party data and making it available in real-time to engagement systems.\r\nAnd second is the increased ROI of tightly coordinating customer engagement with the product journey, often including the delivery of messaging directly inside the product experience. Both of these trends mean that the customer engagement professional who expands their traditional marketing skill set to include a deeper understanding of data analysis, product design and basic coding will find themselves generating higher ROI for their brand and advancing more quickly in their career. Braze's customer education and community investments are designed to help more marketers make this transition and we believe that the integration of generative AI into our platform and the pairing of AI with our Canvas environment more broadly will compound these efforts by further smoothing the on-ramp into Braze for our new customers, while encouraging the use of our advanced targeting personalization and experimentation capabilities for those that are already familiar with Braze.\r\nAll of this is a continuation of a central principle of our product strategy, which is that immense value can be created when you place the power of programmability and data directly into the hands of those who are closest to the customer journey and brand promise. It's why we built Canvas and it's why we continue to view it with not only additional power and flexibility but also with enhanced usability and collaboration tools. And of course, generative AI isn't the whole story. Preceding these features has been a robust collection of automated decision-making techniques, using both machine learning and advanced statistical methods, including our Predictive Suite, Intelligence suite and a personalized varying capability integrated into the Canvas.\r\nSome of these features are already monetized directly through premium add-ons, while others are provided as part of our standard offering, a blended approach that we anticipate continuing as we release more AI features over time. All of these capabilities are integrated deeply into Braze's data flow and execution SAC, and represent early examples of what we believe will be an area of enduring differentiation for Braze. Underlying them is our differentiated architecture which distinguishes Braze from our competitors in three key ways. First is our comprehensive data flow and messaging capabilities. Last fiscal year, Braze processed over 13 trillion data points and sent over 2 trillion messages, all with our real-time stream processor. Customer data flows into Braze across our customer's data ecosystems, inclusive of direct integrations into their products and their data warehouses.\r\nWe are also integrated into a wide array of consumer touchpoints and end user product interfaces, which enables us to take action across many channels. The inputs AI and the direct outputs from its decisions are both more flexible and comprehensive with Braze and the added value this represents is a key component of our ongoing success with vendor consolidation. Next is real-time execution. Our ability to ingest and act on newly generated data in real-time means that AI and Braze is able to make better decisions faster. Braze already employs multiple machine learning and statistical methods to enable automated decision-making in real-time within Canvas and we're experimenting with custom transformers for automated product recommendation that will be able to inject the outputs of generative AI into message content on a per user basis.\r\nThird is our focus on experimentation and programmability. Building on Canvas's flexibility and strengthening experimentation, we'll continue injecting both AI/ML and statistical techniques for automated decision-making into an increasing number of decision points throughout the user journey, enabling new AI techniques to be tested against existing manual strategies and again subsequent enhancement to our AI-driven methods. It's an incredibly exciting time to be leading a team as innovative as Braze in a market with as much potential as customer engagement. And even as we approach our 12-year anniversary this summer, it still feels like we're just getting started. Before I turn it over to Isabelle, I'd like to note that on June 1, we closed the acquisition of North Star, our exclusive reseller of Braze technology in Australia and New Zealand.\r\nWe are thrilled to have brought their team fully in house and look forward to expanding in the Australia and New Zealand markets in the coming months and years. We look forward to updating you on our progress in that dynamic market. Despite macro challenges, we are confident in our ability to execute on our growth plan, while remaining disciplined and on a path to profitability. Further, we believe the investments in our products including generative AI in addition to the strong secular customer engagement wins at our backs positions Braze to become the industry standard for customer engagement in the coming years. And now, I will turn the call over to Isabelle.\r\nIsabelle Winkles: Thank you, Bill, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. As Bill mentioned, we reported a strong first quarter with revenue up 31% year-over-year to $101.8 million. This was driven by a combination of existing customer contract expansion, renewals and new business. Our subscription revenue remains the primary component of our total top-line, contributing 95% of our first quarter revenue. The remaining 5% represents a combination of one-time configuration and onboarding fees as well as other recurring professional services. Total customer count increased 24% year-over-year to 1,866 customers as of April 30, up 363 from the same period last year and up 96 from the prior quarter. Our total number of large customers, which we define as those spending at least $500,000 annually, grew 27% year-over-year to 164 and as of April 30, contributed 57% to our total ARR compared to a 54% contribution as of the same quarter last year.\r\nCompared to last quarter, this reflects a 5% increase from 156 large customers that contributed 57% of our total ARR as of January 31. Measured across all customers, dollar-based net retention was 122%, while dollar-based net retention for large customers was 124%. Expansion was broadly distributed across industries and geographic regions. Revenue outside the U.S. contributed 43% of our total revenue in the first quarter, in line with the prior quarter. In the first quarter, our total remaining performance obligation was $478 million, up 22% year-over-year and up 5% sequentially. Current RPO was $325 million, up 28% year-over-year and up 4% sequentially. The year-over-year increases were driven by contract renewals and upsells and the signing of new customer contracts.\r\nOverall dollar-weighted contract length remains at approximately two years. Non-GAAP gross profit in the quarter was $70 million, representing a non-GAAP gross margin of 68.8%. This compares to a non-GAAP gross profit of $52.5 million and non-GAAP gross margin of 67.8% in the first quarter of last year. The 100 basis point year-over-year margin improvement was driven by ongoing efficiencies related to personnel costs and continued economies of scale in our core technology expenses. Non-GAAP sales and marketing expense was $49.3 million or 48% of revenue compared to $40.2 million or 52% of revenue in the prior year quarter. While the dollar increase reflects our year-over-year investments in headcount costs to support our ongoing growth and global expansion, the improved efficiency reflects our disciplined investment approach to resource deployment across our go-to-market organization.\r\nNon-GAAP R&amp;D expense was $19.6 million or 19% of revenue compared to $15.3 million or 20% of revenue in the prior year quarter. The dollar increase was primarily driven by increased headcount costs to support the expansion of our existing offerings as well as to develop new products and features to drive growth. Non-GAAP G&amp;A expense was $17.1 million or 17% of revenue compared to $15 million or 19% of revenue in the prior year quarter. The dollar increase was driven by investments to support our overall company growth, including headcount costs and increases in software subscription and licenses. Non-GAAP operating loss was $16 million compared to a non-GAAP operating loss of $18 million in the prior year quarter. Non-GAAP net loss attributable to Braze shareholders in the quarter was $12.6 million or a loss of $0.13 per share compared to a loss of $17.7 million or a loss of $0.19 per share in the prior year quarter.\r\nNow turning to the balance sheet and cash flow statement. We ended the quarter with $507.4 million in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities. Cash provided by operations during the quarter was $22.5 million compared to $17.9 million in the prior year quarter, driven by improved operating efficiencies, including improved spend management. While we reiterate that we expect our cash flow to fluctuate from quarter to quarter given the timing of customer and vendor payments, we note that this was the first period in which we delivered two consecutive quarters of positive operating cash flow, reflecting continued improvements in operating efficiency. Taking into consideration, the cash impact of capitalized costs, we generated $21.7 million of positive free cash flow compared to $15.7 million generated in the year ago quarter.\r\nBefore I turn to the forecast, I'd like to make a few brief comments regarding Braze's application of AI and ML capabilities to internal productivity and efficiency. Beyond product use cases, Braze is rapidly experimenting with AI and ML capabilities throughout the organization via projects designed to shorten ramp times, improved productivity and streamline processes. Projects are in flight using both custom large language models and GPT4 via OpenAI's APIs to serve as co-pilots to our sales, solution consulting and post-sales teams, including an exciting project focused on customer support, which we believe will increase productivity and decrease enablement needs by improving discovery and automating research across our comprehensive public facing documentation and internal knowledge base.\r\nAcross G&amp;A functions, we believe there is a significant opportunity to use intelligent automation with machine learning in areas such as forecasting, human resources, accounting operations and internal audit. We will continue to implement and explore automation and AI/ML capabilities to complement decision-making and drive operational efficiencies. And now turning to our forecast. We are off to a strong start in fiscal 2024 and interest in high quality customer engagement solutions remained strong. However, the broader macroeconomic environment remains challenging and as such, our guidance continues to assume the current macro environment persist through fiscal 2024. We intend to maintain cost discipline and reiterate comments made during our Q4 earnings call that we believe we are well positioned to achieve a non-GAAP operating margin of better than negative 7% in Q4 of this year.\r\nFor the second quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $108 million to $109 million, which represents a year-over-year growth rate of approximately 26% at the midpoint. This includes a $1 million contribution from our acquisition of North Star which closed on June 1. For the second quarter, non-GAAP operating loss is expected to be in the range of $15 million to $16 million. Second quarter non-GAAP net loss is expected to be $13 million to $14 million. And second quarter non-GAAP net loss per share in the range of $0.13 to $0.14 per share, based on approximately 97.4 million weighted average basic shares outstanding during the period. For the full fiscal year 2024, we expect total revenue to be in the range of $442.5 million to $446.5 million, which represents a year-over-year growth rate of approximately 25% at the midpoint.\r\nAs a reminder, we expect our North Star acquisition to add less than 2% to fiscal year '24 revenue and our updated full-year guidance includes a $4 million contribution from North Star. Fiscal year 2024 non-GAAP operating loss is expected to be in the range of $54 million to $58 million. Non-GAAP net loss for the same period is expected to be in the range of $50 million to $54 million. Fiscal year 2024 non-GAAP net loss per share is expected to be $0.51 to $0.55 per share based on a full year weighted average basic share count of approximately 97.8 million shares. Our commitment to growing the top line while improving operating income and free cash flow margins remains unchanged. We reiterate that we expect Braze will achieve positive quarterly non-GAAP operating income and positive quarterly free cash flow by the end of fiscal year ended January 31, 2025.\r\nWe are very excited about Braze's future. We're focused on growing our business and delivering best-in-class customer engagement at scale while effectively managing costs to achieve our long-term financial targets. And with that, we'll now open the call for questions.

The technology behind these high temperature electrochemical energy platforms underpins both our Tri-generation and carbon capture platforms, which we believe enables FuelCell Energy to leverage 20 years of operating history and sets the stage for us to meet the evolving needs of our current and future customers.\r\nNext, please turn to key messages for this quarter shown on Slide 4. First, we are very pleased to announce consistent operational progress on key projects. During the quarter, we completed new module exchanges at the plant owned by Korea Southern Power Company in Korea which achieved commercial operations in fiscal year 2018. The new module exchanges were an important driver of our service agreements revenue in the quarter. At our Toyota Port of Long Beach, California project, the FuelCell platform has advanced to the commissioning phase of project deployment and we anticipate that the remaining commissioning activity will be completed and commercial operations will be achieved in our third fiscal quarter. Under our hydrogen power purchase agreement with Toyota, this project has a 20-year firm off take commitment for hydrogen and power and we have entered into a contract with Anaergia to supply renewable natural gas.\r\nWe will continue to leg into gas supply over time, the renewable natural gas is produced from local food waste and municipal wastewater which we expect will allow our Tri-generation system to produce three emission free value streams, hydrogen, electricity, and water for our customer Toyota. In Derby, Connecticut onsite construction of the 14 megawatt project continues to advance and 4 of the 10 modules required for the project have been delivered for installation. Onsite civil construction of the 2.8 megawatt project is also advancing. We expect to achieve commercial operation on both of these projects in the fourth quarter of calendar year 2023. Secondly, we are progressing on the development of advanced applications of our platforms. We received an order from an affiliate of ExxonMobil Technology and Engineering Company or MTEC and ExxonMobil for long lead FuelCell equipment and tooling to be acquired from third party vendors as well as engineering support from the company that would be required in connection with the implementation of a potential carbon capture demonstration.\r\nWe continue to advance our testing work under our joint development agreement with MTEC, which we believe validates our confidence in our carbon capture technology. In addition, we believe that this demonstration project would provide an outstanding opportunity to demonstrate our technology's ability to address one of the largest environmental challenges of today, efficiently and cheaply capturing carbon at the direct point of emissions and destroying Nox. Government incentives such as 45Q in the United States and the carbon border adjustment mechanism in the European Union are just two examples of the global support for reducing carbon emissions. In addition, we recently announced that we have executed a Memorandum of Understanding with Chart Industries to partner in exploring opportunities in carbon capture for user sequestration as well as generation and storage of gaseous or liquefied hydrogen.\r\nI will discuss this in more detail later in the presentation. Thirdly, we are continuing to focus on expanding our solid oxide manufacturing capacity. Our plan to expand manufacturing capacity in our Calgary facility from 4 megawatt to 40 megawatt is progressing. We have more than doubled our manufacturing square footage and we have hired and trained additional team members for a third shift production operation. During calendar year 2023 our Calgary manufacturing operation is expected to build and deliver four units, two units that will run internally for advanced testing and two first article production units for delivery externally. We have started manufacturing the 250 kilowatt electrolysis platform for delivery to Idaho National Laboratories.\r\nconstruction, drill, drilling, energy, equipment, exploration, fuel, gas, gasoline, holland, industrial, industry, maintenance, ocean, offshore, oil, petroleum, plant, platform, port, power, production, pump, refinery, rig, rotterdam, sea, sky, steel, technology, tower, well\r\nCopyright: 1971yes / 123RF Stock Photo\r\nIn addition, we continue to opportunistically evaluate options to benefit from global policy tailwinds. In addition to the Inflation Reduction Act and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act in the United States, global support for green energy includes the European Union's proposed approximately $270 billion program, also known as the European Green Deal and Korea's Clean Hydrogen Energy Portfolio standard, also known as Korea's Hydrogen Economy Roadmap. We believe that these policies will support and drive increasing demand for clean energy technologies to decarbonize power, produce hydrogen, and deliver resiliency, reliability, redundancy, energy security, energy independence, and affordability. Lastly, we continue to focus on maintaining liquidity and exercising a disciplined approach to capital allocation.\r\nSubsequent to the end of the quarter, we closed on an $87 million non-recourse project financing facility. The facility, which was oversubscribed due to strong lender interest, further improves our balance sheet strength and flexibility. Now I will turn the call over to Mike to discuss the financial results for the second quarter, as well as our new financing arrangements in more detail. Mike.\r\nMichael Bishop: Thank you, Jason and good morning to everyone on the call today. Let's begin by reviewing the financial highlights for the quarter shown on Slide 6. For the second quarter of fiscal year 2023 we reported total revenues of 38.3 million compared to 16.4 million in the second quarter of fiscal year 2022, an increase of 134%. Net loss was 33.9 million in the second quarter of fiscal year 2023, compared to net loss of 30.1 million in the second quarter of fiscal year 2022. The resulting net loss per share attributable to common stockholders in the second quarter of fiscal year 2023 was negative $0.09, compared to negative $0.08 in the second quarter of fiscal year 2022. Adjusted EBITDA totaled negative 26 million in the second quarter of fiscal year 2023 compared to adjusted EBITDA of negative 21.2 million in the second quarter of fiscal year 2022.\r\nPlease see the discussion of non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EBITDA in the appendix at the end of our earnings release. Finally, the company held total cash, cash equivalents, and short term investments of over $350 million as of April 30, 2023. Next, please turn to Slide 7 for additional details on our financial performance and backlog. The chart on the left hand side graphically shows our revenue composition by line item. Looking at revenue drivers by category; service agreement revenues increased to 26.2 million from 2.6 million. Service agreement revenues recognized during the second quarter of fiscal year 2023 were primarily driven by new module exchanges at the plant owned by Korea Southern Power Company in Korea while there were no new module exchanges during the comparable prior year quarter.\r\nThe company expects a lower level of module exchanges during the balance of the fiscal year. Generation revenues decreased to 8.4 million from 9.1 million, which is primarily the result of the timing of revenue recognition for the sale of renewable energy credits compared to the comparable prior year period. Advanced technology contract revenues decreased to 3.7 million from 4.7 million. Compared to the second quarter of fiscal year 2022 Advanced Technologies contract revenues recognized under our joint development agreement with ExxonMobil Technology and Engineering Company were approximately $0.3 million higher, and revenue recognized under government and other contracts were approximately $1.3 million lower as a result of the allocation of engineering resources during the quarter.\r\nLooking at the top right hand side of the slide, I will walk through the changes in gross loss and operating expenses. Gross loss for the second quarter of fiscal year 2023 totaled 6.1 million compared to a gross loss of 7.3 million in the comparable prior year quarter. The decrease in gross loss is primarily due to favorable service agreement in gross margins partially offset by the decrease in generation revenue of gross margin resulting from a project asset impairment and a decrease in gross profit for advanced technologies. Operating expenses for the second quarter of fiscal year 2023 increased to 29.8 million from 20.9 million in the second quarter of fiscal year 2022. Administrative and selling expenses were higher during the second quarter of fiscal year 2023, primarily due to an increase in headcount.\r\nResearch and development expenses increased to 14.7 million during the second quarter of fiscal year 2023, primarily due to an increase in spending on the company's ongoing commercial development efforts related to our solid oxide power generation and electrolysis platforms in carbon separation and carbon capture solutions compared to the prior year period. On the bottom right of the slide, you will see that we finished the quarter with backlog of approximately $1 billion, a decrease of 23% compared to backlog as of April 30, 2022. Reduction in backlog is due in part to the decision in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022, not to move forward with certain generation projects given their economic profiles at the time, as well as revenue recognition under product, generation, and service agreements since April 30, 2022.\r\nOn Slide 8 is an update on our liquidity and ongoing investment in project assets. As of April 30, 2023, we had total cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments of $353.5 million. This total includes 246.8 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents represented by the darker blue bar on the chart in the center of the slide, 30.2 million of restricted cash and cash equivalents represented by the purple bar and 76.4 million of short-term investments represented by the lighter blue bar. The short-term investments represent the amortized cost of U.S. Treasury Securities purchased by the company during the first and second quarters of fiscal year 2023 as part of the company's cash management optimization effort, all of which are expected to be held to maturity.\r\nLooking at the right hand side of the slide, there is a chart illustrating our total project assets which make up our company owned generation portfolio. As of April 30, 2023, our gross project assets totaled $273.2 million, which excludes accumulated depreciation. As detailed on Slide 19 in the appendix of this presentation, our generation portfolio totaled 63.1 megawatts of assets as of April 30, 2023. This includes 43.7 megawatts of operating assets and 19.4 megawatts of projects in process. As projects in process begin commercial operation, they are expected to contribute to higher generation revenue. Now please turn to Slide 9, which is a great example of how the company has been able to recycle cash from our generation portfolio. We were very pleased to close on a new project financing agreement subsequent to the end of our second quarter.\r\nIn spite of the current challenges in the fixed income markets, we were able to diversify our sources of capital and increase the efficiency of our financing structure by entering into an $87 million non-recourse project financing facility. After a portion of the proceeds were used to repay some of the company's existing indebtedness and certain restricted and unrestricted reserve accounts and cash reserves were released at closing, this financing transaction yielded net cash proceeds to FuelCell Energy of 60.6 million, of which 46.1 million is unrestricted and may be used to accelerate commercialization of our hydrogen FuelCell technologies for strategic initiatives and for general corporate purposes. 14.5 million of the net cash proceeds is restricted and has been used to fund performance reserves.\r\nWe partnered with a diverse bank group consisting of Investec Bank, Bank of Montreal, Liberty Bank, Amalgamated Bank, and Connecticut Green Bank. This facility provides a seven-year term loan at competitive interest rates secured by six of our long-term contracted operating assets which are contracted with investment grade counterparties. Finally, please turn to Slide 10. I would like to confirm that our projected investments that we introduced at the beginning of the fiscal year are on track. The three primary targeted areas for investments are capital commitments for property, plant and equipment, research and development, and continued buildout of our generation portfolio. Capital commitments for property, plant and equipment are expected to range between 60 million to 90 million for fiscal year 2023.\r\nWe expect cash for these commitments will be expended over fiscal years 2023 and 2024. CAPEX includes expected investments in our manufacturing facilities for both carbonate, including carbon capture and solid oxide production capacity expansion. The addition of test facilities for new products and components, the expansion of our laboratories and upgrades to and expansion of our business systems. The solid oxide production capacity expansion is well underway in our Calgary, Canada facility. In addition, we are evaluating the potential for additional manufacturing facilities in the United States to complement Calgary and support the growth that we anticipate. Looking at research and development, our R&amp;D efforts continue to be focused on commercialization of our hydrogen technologies, including long duration energy storage and carbon capture.\r\nWe estimate that full year R&amp;D expenses for fiscal year 2023 will be in the range of $50 million to $70 million. We estimate that full year expenditures for project assets will be in the range of $45 million to $65 million. This includes the amounts being expensed for the Toyota project. As projects in our generation portfolio begin operation under long-term power purchase agreements and hydrogen power purchase agreements, we expect this investment to translate into growth in recurring revenues and provide continued opportunities for tax equity and back leveraged debt financing. All of the investments that I have described on this slide are expected to drive future growth. In closing, I am pleased with the progress made this past quarter. From a financial perspective, we believe that we remain well positioned to execute on our near, medium, and long-term powerhouse business strategy.\r\nI will now turn the call back over to Jason.\r\nA - Jason Few: Thanks Mike. As we have stated in previous quarters, our powerhouse business strategy serves as our framework for achieving long-term growth. I will summarize our approach on Slide 12. The first tenet is growth. We are working to optimize our business for achieving growth in markets where we see significant opportunities for our platform technologies. We have created geographic market segment and application specific playbooks that are focused on building a robust sales pipeline. Our business development team is focused on moving the pipeline from prospects to executed agreements. The second is scale. We plan to scale our existing platforms by investing in, extending and deepening our leadership and total human capital across the organization.\r\nAcross our operations, we are focused on optimizing manufacturing capacity for our carbonate platform with the goal of achieving 100 megawatts of annualized integrated onsite manufacturing and conditioning capacity. We are also working to expand our solid oxide manufacturing capabilities with a goal of adding an additional 400 megawatts of manufacturing capacity in the United States. We believe that the legislation enacted and being contemplated around the world will over time, serve as a catalyst to support the acceleration of adoption of products like ours and to ultimately drive down cost. And third, innovate. Over our 50-year history, we have never stopped innovating. As shown on the earlier slide, we have hundreds of patents granted or pending in jurisdictions around the world.\r\nWe believe our technologies and our culture provide the opportunity for our participation in the growth of the hydrogen economy and carbon capture market and will enable us to deliver on our purpose to enable a world empowered by clean energy. We are working to develop diversified revenue streams by delivering a range of solutions and services anchored by our multi feature platforms that support the global energy transition. Please turn to Slide 13. Our collaboration with Chart Industries announced after the end of the second quarter is a great example of how we plan to innovate and work with partners to deliver complete solutions to our customers. We are excited to collaborate with Chart Industries with the goal of delivering innovative, sustainable solutions for our customers.\r\nAs you may know, Chart Industries is a leading technology company that provides equipment and services for a range of applications, including CO2 and hydrogen, liquefaction and compression. We at FuelCell Energy plan to bring our expertise in manufacturing high temperature electrochemical FuelCell energy platforms to the collaboration. Our intent is to apply our two companies complementary strengths to deliver reliable and efficient carbon dioxide capture for use or sequestration, as well as generation and storage of gaseous or liquefied hydrogen. As an example, in the food and beverage industry, beverage grade CO2 is a critical input but is often in short supply, lacks clear price signals, and generally does not offer long-term price or supply hedging.\r\nWe believe our combined capabilities can help provide this sector with consistent pricing, surety of supply availability, and quality. We look forward to providing updates as this relationship further develops. Before moving to Q&amp;A, I will conclude with takeaways on Slide 14. I'm excited about how over the last four years, our company has navigated our transformational journey. Our technologies under development are progressing toward commercialization, and we believe that these technologies will have a positive impact on our world in the future. We are making consistent operational progress. We are executing on large, complex projects for our customers, improving the capabilities of our multifunction technologies, with two projects expected to begin commercial operation in the next six months.\r\nWe are making progress on developing advanced applications of our platforms and are continuing to collaborate with MTEC and working to develop new collaborative relationships with companies like Chart Industries. We are working to expand our solid oxide manufacturing capacity. We believe that our investment in such expansion will support our future ability to capture market opportunities for sub-megawatt power generation and high efficiency electrolysis products. Globally, policies to support the energy transition are gaining momentum with the Inflation Reduction Act in the United States, as well as efforts we are seeing internationally. And we believe we are well positioned to benefit from these tailwinds. We have worked to maintain our liquidity, have remained focused on disciplined capital allocation, and have expanded our banking relationships.\r\nWe believe we are positioned for future growth. We believe FuelCell Energy is well positioned to capture market opportunities over the coming years and deliver enhanced shareholder returns over the long run. I will now turn it over to the operator to begin Q&amp;A.\r\nSee also 12 Best Short Squeeze Stocks to Buy Now\r\n\u00a0and 11 Best Health Insurance Stocks to Buy\r\n.\r\nTo continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.",

Reported EPS is $-0.18 EPS, expectations were $-0.15.\r\nOperator: Good morning, everyone. My name is Bruno and I will be your conference operator for today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the SecureWorks First Quarter Fiscal 2024 Financial Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] A supplemental slide presentation to accompany the prepared remarks can be found on the company's website. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Kevin Toomey, SecureWorks Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Toomey, you may begin your conference.\r\nKevin Toomey: Thanks, everyone, for joining us. With me this morning are Wendy Thomas, our CEO; and Christian Grant, our Interim CFO. During this call, unless otherwise indicated, we will reference non-GAAP financial measures. You will find the reconciliations between these GAAP and non-GAAP measures in the press release and presentation posted on our website earlier today. Please also note that all growth percentages refer to year-over-year changes unless otherwise specified. Finally, I'd like to remind you that all statements made during this call that relate to future results and events are forward-looking statements based on current expectations. Actual results and events could differ materially from those projected due to a number of risks and uncertainties, which are discussed in our press release, web deck and SEC filings. We assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements. Now I'll turn the call over to SecureWorks CEO, Wendy Thomas.\r\nWendy Thomas: Thank you, Kevin, and welcome, everyone. Taegis continues to lead the industry with 68% year-over-year revenue growth, expanding to $63 million in the first quarter. Taegis annual recurring revenue expanded to $269 million at the end of the first quarter and now represents over 85% of our total ARR, up from less than half of total ARR this time last year. To put that into context, this quarter, we were recognized by multiple leading industry analyst reports as one of the top three largest providers of managed detection and response in the market. That's important because customers have a choice in a noisy market and they're choosing SecureWorks. In my conversations with potential customers, in this climate of increased focus on fiscal responsibility, they are focused on the win-win that Taegis can deliver.\r\nA solution that helps them consolidate and reduce the number of security vendors that they have to manage, that scales their spend on both security technology and talent while simultaneously delivering an improved security risk posture and outcomes. We are well positioned to address this market need based on our unique approach to the design of our Taegis XDR platform and customers are reaping the benefits of our XDR enabled MDR. We solved the signal-to-noise problem that drives alert fatigue from multiple point products. We provide a comprehensive protection to stop adversaries who look between point products and our open without compromise approach gives customers choice, future flexibility and an easy deployment path to achieve comprehensive detection and response.\r\nIn this vein, we are addressing an acute need to replace legacy SIMs, which are difficult to deploy and configure and their complexity makes them costly to maintain. For example, in first quarter, we won a global provider of smart building solutions that came to SecureWorks originally for penetration testing services. We quickly discovered a ransomware attack despite their significant investments in a SEM, an endpoint and vulnerability management technologies. Like so many organizations, they did not have the resources to constantly manage the SEM until left many of their office locations unmonitored. They quickly recognize the return on investment of managed detection and response with Taegis, reduce their vendor sprawl and spend while fully securing their entire environment.\r\nCustomers choose Taegis for its measurable and superior return on investment that lets them streamline security vendors and spend, increase the value of uptime of their business operations and revenue streams and the ability to optimize investments in internal security teams, all while achieving superior security outcomes, quantifiable risk reduction. We also expanded our platform capabilities and portfolio of offerings this quarter. We recently announced two new offerings to unify the way companies prevent, detect and respond to threats across both OT and IT environments, eliminating the visibility challenges often associated with the separation of those systems and addressing the risks of greater attack service exposure in legacy OT systems.\r\nIndustrials and multiple sectors have been increasingly under attack by threat actors. And with our significant presence and expertise in this vertical today, we see untapped potential to solve a pressing security needs by unifying detection and response across OT and IT via the Taegis platform and staying true to our overall approach to XDR. The pricing is simple and predictable, endpoint-based upcharge with no data overage, storage or other surprise fees. In support of customer choice and aligned with our pillar to be open without compromise, we recently added out-of-the-box support for a growing integration request from our customers and partners, SentinelOne's Singularity Complete. Taegis now ingest SentinelOne telemetry into an overall view of cloud identity, network and other application data in the Taegis XDR UI, enriches and correlates that data with threat context and applies our unique detectors and response actions in the platform to drive superior security outcomes.\r\nWith our unique approach in Taegis, customers can leverage a single EDR agent for holistic XDR and MDR coverage, further removing the friction and complexity of multi-vendor environments. With this addition, we now integrate seamlessly with nearly 70% of the endpoint market, another example of how we optimize customers' existing and future cybersecurity investments while also providing the breadth of security coverage they need. Taegis is increasingly there's no pane of glass for our customers' entire security stack. We recently won a partner source deal with a manufacturing company that had a small IT team, no stock and very limited visibility into their environment. And a competitor in their space had recently been the victim of a cyber-attack and data breach, creating urgency and their leadership team around ensuring they could prevent a similar breach.\r\nDen Rise/Shutterstock.com\r\nThe customer had recently implemented SentinelOne with our partner, and our demo and proof-of-concept demonstrating the ease of deployment and holistic visibility of XDR while leveraging their existing single agents. Those are what steal the deal. Another topic that is top of mind for customers and investors is how we leverage and govern AI in our Taegis platform and offering. From the beginning, AI has been part of our Taegis platform vision and architecture leveraged to drive more effective and faster, the detection and response outcomes for customers. Among many approaches, we leverage deep learning and machine learning and our thousands of detectors to find the true positives that other products miss. And AI-enabled threat scores support the prioritization of the hundreds of billions of alerts and indicators we receive from our customers daily.\r\nWhile approaches in AI algorithms can change rapidly, the key to staying ahead is having vast amounts of labeled training data, and we believe that we have one of the most valuable security training datasets globally. For example, we've performed more than 10,000 investigations annually for more than a decade. Leveraging that dataset, we recently implemented natural language processing, generative AI and other techniques to automate approximately 45% of our Taegis security investigation reports. While more opportunity lies ahead, this has further improved our market-leading response time for customers and the efficiency of our security operations. While AI is not a panacea and is not applicable to all security use cases, we are well positioned to capitalize on its momentum and opportunity.\r\nWe have a deep bench of data scientists, software engineers and threat researchers working on a true XDR platform designed to take advantage of advancements in AI and data analytics to rapidly innovate to improve outcomes for our customers while protecting their most valuable assets. As importantly, we have educated our team and put in place sustained governance around the responsible use of AI, and we'll continue to safely incorporate it into our business and service of customers, teammates and investors. I'll now turn to our go-to-market. We are in the early innings of our go-to-market transformation, aligned to our Taegis centric business model, but I'm pleased with our progress. We designed Taegis to be transparent and collaborative providing flexibility and optionality around who manages detection and response activities.\r\nThis enables MDR to be delivered by SecureWorks, a partner or a customer's own SOC team, all leveraging Taegis XDR. In addition to solution providers as a go-to-market path, this has enabled us to tap into the MSSP market opportunity, enabling partners to deliver high margin and effective MDR leveraging Taegis. In Q1, one of our MSSP partners worked with us on an MDR deal with a data analytics software provider that was using multiple security providers to manage different aspects of their security operations. They had a small security team, which made it challenging for them to keep track of threats and costly to manage and get the security value across these disparate partners. Taegis has brought the holistic streamlined approach they needed while also addressing their growing compliance needs, with the scaled MDR services from our partner.\r\nRecall that last December, SecureWorks launched our partner first go-to-market approach in North America, elevating our collaboration with critical managed service and solution providers as well as technology alliance partners. Our open without compromise strategy creates greater business opportunities for partners of all types. As an indicator of traction in first quarter, more than 60% of global Taegis new logo business was closed with a partner, up from 40% this time a year ago and partners with active pipeline have increased 40%, leading to a doubling of our partner pipeline in first quarter, a trend we expect to ramp over the course of this year. And we will continue to extend this partner-first strategy globally over the course of this year.\r\nWe've brought in a seasoned Chief Revenue Officer to accelerate our go-to-market transformation. Allan Peters comes with a powerful combination of CRO leadership across SaaS, security product and services companies with a partner-led sales approach. He brings demonstrated success in driving incremental ARR growth by accelerating new customer acquisitions, platform adoption and channel growth and an expanding gross margin through better solutions mix and discount control, all driving improvements in key sales efficiency measures. Before I transition into our path to profitable growth, I'll just add color on our perspective on the macro environment in terms of its impact on sales. We did see longer sales cycles in first quarter than a year ago, largely as a result of increased layers of deal review at customers.\r\nBut those sales cycle times have been largely in line with more recent quarterly trends. Based on what we see currently, we expect this to continue in the near term. We are driving our business to profitable growth as we complete our business transformation. Taegis continues to perform, growing faster than the industry and scaling gross margin. And as a business, we have and will continue to take decisive actions to align our cost structure with the SaaS nature and the revenue opportunity of our Taegis-centric business model. While Chris will provide more details, I'll highlight three primary areas of action that give us confidence in our ability to drive growing profitability into next year. First, we will continue to take advantage of automation and scale throughout the business.\r\nSecond, our go-to-market transformation, in addition to benefiting the top line will drive increased sales efficiency. Third, we are accelerating the reduction of the remaining duplicative and transition costs as we wind down our other MSS business. Of note, the second quarter of this fiscal year will represent the inflection point for total revenue for SecureWorks with a return to sequential total revenue growth in the second half of this year. Very shortly, Alpana Wegner, will join us as our new CFO. Alpana brings to SecureWorks extensive experience developing business strategies, to drive outsized growth and strengthening organization's financial profiles by increasing scale and expanding EBITDA margins through operational efficiency. We have a clear path and a commitment to managing our business to profitable growth.\r\nI want to thank our customers and partners for joining forces with us and my thanks to our teammates for their hard work and commitment to the SecureWorks mission of securing human progress. I particularly want to thank Chris Grant for his partnership and support acting as our Interim CFO for the past month. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Chris to walk through our financial results and guidance.\r\nChristian Grant: Thanks, Wendy. Good morning, everyone. Today, I will cover our first quarter results and outlook for the second quarter and fiscal year 2024. Total revenue was $94.4 million in the first quarter, which compares to our guidance of $96 million to $98 million. The lower total revenue was driven by accelerated wind down of our other MSS business and customers delaying professional services projects. As a reminder, our professional services business includes both retainer-based and transactional services. In Q1, the delays we saw were in the transactional revenue, which can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter due to the dependency on customer resource availability. Adjusted EBITDA loss was $20.1 million compared to a $7.8 million loss in prior year first quarter.\r\nThe overall change was driven by the other MSS and professional services revenue just discussed. Offset by Taegis gross profit expansion and OpEx savings as we continue to align our cost structure with our Taegis-centric business. Overall, Taegis business performed in the first quarter as expected. Taegis subscription revenue was $62.6 million, up 68% year-over-year, in line with expectations. Taegis ARR increased nearly $90 million year-over-year to $269 million now representing more than 85% of our total ARR. With our resolutioning efforts substantially completed at the end of fiscal '23, the majority of our Taegis ARR growth this quarter was driven by new logos, upsell and cross-sell. Average revenue per Taegis customer was approximately 132,000 and we've added 600 Taegis customers since the first quarter of last year, representing year-over-year growth of 43%.\r\nI would like to highlight that Taegis average revenue per customer remained at a premium to the industry average. We took the unique approach of bundling a number of core capabilities such as one-year data retention, orchestration and hunting playbooks, endpoint agent and unlimited response in our core offering. Our higher average revenue per customer than our competitors benefits from the strategy and our target buyer segments. To provide more insights into the underlying financials of our Taegis business, we've enhanced our disclosures this quarter, providing a breakout of Taegis cost of revenue and gross margin. Taegis gross margin continues to scale, reaching 70% this quarter, 110 basis points higher than the first quarter a year ago. As we move towards the other MSS end of life in Japan in Q1 of next year, ARR and revenue in that business will continue to wind down.\r\nWe anticipate eliminating the remainder of our other MSS cost structure at the same time that we sunset other MSS in Japan in Q2 of next year. As Wendy shared, we have also been actively managing down our OpEx as we align our expense base to our Taegis-centric business. Turning now to our cash and balance sheet. We finished the quarter with a strong balance sheet with $95 million of cash, no debt and an undrawn credit facility. We used $42 million of cash from operations compared with $25 million used in the prior year first quarter, which primarily reflected lower adjusted EBITDA. As a reminder, our first quarter is seasonally the highest use of cash due to annual incentive payouts. Turning to our guidance for the second quarter and fiscal year '24.\r\nWe are reiterating our guidance for Taegis ARR to end FY '24 at $300 million or higher. We expect other MSS ARR to represent approximately 5% of total ARR at the end of this fiscal year. Our full year total revenue guidance range is $380 million to $400 million with second quarter revenue of $90 million to $92 million. We continue to anticipate full year Taegis revenue to be $270 million to $280 million. Taegis gross margins are expected to expand from first quarter level as we progress throughout the year. The benefit of that within the total gross margin will be offset by duplicative fixed and transition costs as we sunset support for our other MSS services in Japan. We have previously stated that there are approximately $25 million of duplicative fixed and transition-related costs that we are incurring with $15 million in cost of revenues and $10 million in operating expenses.\r\nAs we turn down other MSS services, we will manage the related cost out, one of several positive impacts to our operating structure in fiscal '24 and fiscal '25. As Wendy shared, we are actively managing our cost structure. We expect reductions in our operating costs to begin in the second half of the year as we align our resource allocation based on the faster runoff of the other MSS business. We have experienced significant improvements in our cost structure from our ongoing use of automation. We continue to drive automation and scale into our growing SaaS business. As our teams deploy AI across operations, we see improvements in all areas of our business, both in ways that directly benefit customers and in the scale of our operating model.\r\nOur investment in sales and marketing over the past year have enabled the repositioning of our brand, completing the resolutioning outside of Japan and supporting our transition to partner first model. It is early days in our partner first go-to-market. But with the resolution behind us in North America, we began recomposing our sales force by expanding our hunter capacity and reducing investments in account executives focused on resolution. This will be apparent in lower sales and marketing dollars spent this year as we are no longer compensating account executives to move existing customers from our other MSS platform to Taegis. R&amp;D will also trend lower as we continue to reduce our engineering support costs related to our other MSS business.\r\nFull year adjusted EBITDA range is expected to be between negative $29 million and $39 million. Finally, full year non-GAAP EPS loss is expected to be between $0.34 and $0.43. We expect Q2 non-GAAP EPS loss to be between $0.15 to $0.17. In summary, Taegis continued to show strong momentum in the first quarter, in line with our expectations. As the sunset of our other MSS accelerates and we benefit from scale on our Taegis-centric business, Q2 is the trough in the transformation of our business. We expect our actions in fiscal '24 to lead our business to profitable growth next year. Thank you for joining us on the call today. Wendy will rejoin us as we begin Q&amp;A. Operator, can you please introduce the first question.\r\nSee also 12 Best Short Squeeze Stocks to Buy Now and 11 Best Health Insurance Stocks to Buy.\r\nTo continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.",

A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than June 13, 2023. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.\r\nWHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases.
